# BRT Planning Guide 4th Edition

The guide is currently is in its final revisions, with intention to be released in the beggining of 2016.

Pre-release chapters can be found on [ITDP's go public page](https://go.itdp.org/display/public/Final+BRT+PG), on MS-Office ".doc" format, and linked  in the [Table of Contents](#TOC)

This is an attempt to bring the guide content to a functional format that would:
- encourage contributions;
- generation of html and/or ".pdf" from the same source;

Based on [this experience](http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/), that accepts contributions [here](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/HaxeManual) markdown seems an appropriate format. (By the end of Sept 2015 I have learned that they intend to shift from current [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) to markdown (".md").) and use a conversion tool from markdown to ".tex" format.

".md"  instead of ".tex" has the additional advantage of allowing a relatively nice linked view immediately for contributors, that is without any processing. Although we foresee the eventual need to create a few tools to deal with current flavour of markdown used in git, we will, for now stick to it as an experience.

At this moment, this is just pasting one chapter from doc (Chapter 24th, that I was hired to review in ".doc" format) and marking it down...
... to later try to generate a nice pdf and/or html format from it with [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) for fine printing format (or LaTeX for not-so-fine format).

If this test succeeds than, we may convert (or write a conversor) for other chapters and any given time, one may freeze this repository and work on a fine print with TeX or other tool.

Documents still can be written in MS-Word or Open Office Writer to make use of spell checking, but need to be saved as plain text ('.txt').
