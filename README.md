# BRT Planning Guide 4th Edition

The guide is currently is in its final revisions, with intention to be released in the begging of 2016.

Pre-release chapters can be found on [ITDP's go public page](https://go.itdp.org/display/public/Final+BRT+PG), on MS-Office ".doc" format, and linked  in the [Table of Contents](#TOC)

This is an attempt to bring the guide content to a functional format that would:
- allow open contributions
- generation of html and pdf from the same source

Based on [this experience](http://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/), that accepts contributions [here](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/HaxeManual), LaTeX seems an appropriate tool for doing it.

At this moment, this is just pasting one chapter from doc (Chapter 24th, that I was hired to review in ".doc" format) and marking it down to try to generate a nice pdf format from it.
