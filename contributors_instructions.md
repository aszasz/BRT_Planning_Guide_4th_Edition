##### Terminology

1. The words “public transport” should always be used in place of “transit”.

2. When describing BRT vehicles, the word “vehicles” should be used and not “buses”.  The word “bus” should be used when discussing conventional bus systems.

3. The words “fare system” should be used instead of “ticketing system”.

4. BRT stations should always be referred to as “stations” rather than shelters or stops.

5. Firms responsible for BRT operations should be termed “vehicle operating companies”. 


### Misc. Style

1. Use British spellings (e.g., revolutionise, realisable, metre).

2. Punctuation is placed outside of quotation marks if not part of a quoted sentence (e.g., The name, “Transmilenio”, chosen for… or the economy is starting from a “very strong position”.). Punctuation is placed inside the quotation marks if part of the quoted sentence: “Prediction is difficult, especially about the future.”

3. Use double quotation marks, not single (e.g., the “crush capacity” and NOT ‘crush capacity’).

4. Use serial commas (in lists of more than two items, place comma after each item (e.g., Jakarta, Bogotá, and New York).

5. Currency should be listed in US dollars like this: US$1 million, or US$70.2 million.

6. Use commas to separate city and country names in running text, not parentheses (e.g., Chennai, India and NOT Chennai (India)). See appendix for list of cities for which country name not necessary.


7. In general, use the local spelling of all cities for Latin America.  For example, use São Paulo and not Sao Paulo. Use Bogotá and not Bogota. Use Goiânia and not Goiania.  However, use Mexico City and not Ciudad de México, unless referring to the whole Federal District, in which case it should be stated as México D.F.  Use Guatemala City and not the Ciudad de Guatemala. 

8. Measurements are given in metric units (e.g., kilometres, metres,); spell out kilometres and metres unless in a table or unless used with the abbreviation kph.

9. Use a hyphen with compound modifiers before a noun:
light-rail system
cost-effective option
long-desired moment
trunk-and-feeder system

Compound modifiers after the noun are usually left open (no hyphen):
a system of light rail
an option that is cost effective
a moment long desired
a system that is trunk and feeder

Use a hyphen with numerical modifiers before a noun:
193-page article
ten-foot pole
eight-year-old buses


##### Numbers

1. In running text spell out exact numbers from one to one hundred as well as round hundreds, thousands, millions, etc. Use figures for exact numbers of 101 or more:
three
seventy-six
one hundred
101
153
nine hundred US dollars, but US$152 and US$900.25
two thousand
2,535
5.6 million
twenty million

Use figures for percentages:
18 percent

Use figures for distances and speeds:
27 kilometres
45 kph

Use figures for decimals:
.85 saturation level
1.5 minutes

Use figures for dates and for numbers referring to parts of the book:
in 1968
chapter 60
figure 8.4

When referring to similar things within a paragraph, do not use figures for some and spell out others. If the largest number contains three or more digits, use figures for all:
104 vehicles and 3 stations

Spell out any number that starts a sentence, or rewrite to avoid:
One hundred thirty-two journalists were present for the ceremony. (Not One hundred and thirty-two)


##### Captions

1. Captions should be pithy descriptions of images. Utilize proper punctuation and grammar. For instance, “Dar es Salaam has successfully combined a full local team with international consultants.” Or “Modern vehicles can give BRT systems a highly professional image. The vehicle in this photo is a Civis bus and not a light-rail vehicle.” 
Note the use of punctuation, articles, and roman type – do not italicize captions.
