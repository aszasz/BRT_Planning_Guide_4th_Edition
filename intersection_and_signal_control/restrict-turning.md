The capacity of the intersection is generally a function of the amount of green time per lane.  The amount of green time per lane is generally a function of the number of signal phases.  Saturation can increase up to 300 percent by increasing an intersection from two or three phases to four phases. 

### Reducing intersections

Sometimes, intersections are too close together in order to optimise the station location relative to the intersection.  In such instances, an assessment has to be made in terms of how important the station location is for boarding and alighting passengers.  If it is an important location, the time savings benefits for pedestrians of locating a station close to this destination must be weighed against the likelihood time lost within the BRT system due to interference between the station and the intersection.   If there are no important destinations in that location, it is better not to locate a station there.  

Mixed traffic vehicles will most likely be able to pass through the two intersections using a synchronised signalisation system.  However, the same may not be true for BRT vehicles.  Instead, the BRT vehicle will pass through the green phase at the first intersection and then stop at the station for passenger boarding and alighting.  By the time the vehicle resumes movement towards the second intersection the signal phase may well have changed to red (Figure 9.48).  Thus, this configuration may lead to considerable delay for public transport passengers.

Figure 9.48 While mixed traffic vehicles may benefit from a synchronised green phase between two intersections, BRT passengers may encounter the red phase at the second intersection.

Even for normal mixed traffic, having two intersections too close together will sometimes lead to problems.  Vehicles queued at one intersection will back up to the point where vehicles are unable to clear the previous intersection during a green phase.   Equation 9.12 defines the calculation for the distance at which this type of conflict may occur.

Equation 9.12 Calculating the distance at which intersection conflicts occur

D12 < 3 * Max ( Tg1, Tg2 )

Where:

D12 = Distance between intersection 1 and intersection 2

Tg1 = Green signal time per phase cycle at intersection 1 

Tg2 = Green signal time per phase cycle at intersection 2

A mixed traffic lane can generally handle 1,800 vehicles per hour.  This quantity translates to two vehicles per second (3,600 seconds in an hour).  When vehicles are stopped at a stop light, the average amount of space they take up is 6 metres; this space includes the vehicle and some space between vehicles.  This average vehicle distance means that for each second of time, 3 metres of vehicle-equivalents can be moved through the intersection.  

Box 9.4 provides a sample calculation of the required spacing between two intersections.
