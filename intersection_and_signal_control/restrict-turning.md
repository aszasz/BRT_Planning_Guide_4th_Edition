 ## Restricting General Traffic Turning Movements

**"Change means movement. Movement means friction. Only in the frictionless vacuum of a non-existent abstract world can movement or change occur without that abrasive friction of conflict."** - Saul Alinsky, political activist, 1909 – 1972



The overall capacity of the intersection is given by the sum of the capacity of each phase. By its turn, the capacity of each phase will be given by the sum of saturation flow of active approaching lanes on that phase multiplied by the  amount of relative green time of that phase. 

No matter how many phases there is on the traffic light, the sum of relative green for all vehicular phases with relative lost time is constant (if there was no pedestrian phases, it would be equal 1). Programming the traffic light is basically dividing this fixed amount among the phases. If the number of phases is increases, the average number of flowing lanes per phase will decrease. Assuming  the saturation flow per lane is the same (for turning it can be lower), decreasing the average number of lanes per phase implies that the higher the number of phases, lower is the overall intersection capacity.

This is empirically clear, a larger number of phases in a traffic light means waiting longer and having a lower share of green time.

Demand saturation level can increase up to 300 percent by increasing an intersection from three phases to four phases. 


### Eliminating intersections

Eliminating intersections along the busway seems at first a good idea. For median-side busway this can be provided by simply forbidding cross-traffic, while still allowing flow from transversal street join the mixed-traffic in the corridor to the kerb-side as in figure \fignum(quito-closed-cross).

![quito-closed-cross](quito-closed-crossing.jpg "Prior to Quito’s Ecovía line, mixed-traffic vehicles were allowed to cross through this intersection as well as negotiate cross-traffic and kerb-side turns. To give priority to public transport, crossing straight  and cross-traffic turn movement have been blocked. Photo by Lloyd Wright.")

This measure indistinctly applied will reduce accessibility and concentrate demand in few locations (figure \fignum(permeability)). Before eliminating an intersection, it is necessary to understand which alternatives paths the demand will use to cross the corridor and compare the impacts of both situations: if the volumes are low or if the alternatives will not cause more delay to the BRT then it is really a good idea eliminate the intersection.

Eventually, create new intersections, to split conflicting volume of one intersection into several is the needed strategy to increase green times for the BRT.

![permeability](img/permeability.png "Closing intersections reduces accessibility, and may lead to harder to handle interesections. ith no stations, BRT vehicles can benefit from signal coordination. Image courtesy of Elebeta.")

If there are no stations in the surrounding, then BRT vehicles can pass through several intersections at once if a synchronised signal system is used (figure \fignum(BRT-fail-synchro)) 

Sometimes, intersections are too close together in order to optimise the station location relative to the intersection.  In such instances, an assessment has to be made in terms of how important the station location is for boarding and alighting passengers.  If it is an important location, the time savings benefits for pedestrians of locating a station close to this destination must be weighed against the likelihood time lost within the BRT system due to interference between the station and the intersection.   If there are no important destinations in that location, it is better not to locate a station there.  

Mixed traffic vehicles will most likely be able to pass through the two intersections using a synchronised signalisation system.  However, the same may not be true for BRT vehicles.  Instead, the BRT vehicle will pass through the green phase at the first intersection and then stop at the station for passenger boarding and alighting.  By the time the vehicle resumes movement towards the second intersection the signal phase may well have changed to red (Figure 9.48).  Thus, this configuration may lead to considerable delay for public transport passengers.

Figure 9.48 While mixed traffic vehicles may benefit from a synchronised green phase between two intersections, BRT passengers may encounter the red phase at the second intersection.

Even for normal mixed traffic, having two intersections too close together will sometimes lead to problems.  Vehicles queued at one intersection will back up to the point where vehicles are unable to clear the previous intersection during a green phase.   Equation 9.12 defines the calculation for the distance at which this type of conflict may occur.

Equation 9.12 Calculating the distance at which intersection conflicts occur

D12 < 3 * Max ( Tg1, Tg2 )

Where:

D12 = Distance between intersection 1 and intersection 2

Tg1 = Green signal time per phase cycle at intersection 1 

Tg2 = Green signal time per phase cycle at intersection 2

A mixed traffic lane can generally handle 1,800 vehicles per hour.  This quantity translates to two vehicles per second (3,600 seconds in an hour).  When vehicles are stopped at a stop light, the average amount of space they take up is 6 metres; this space includes the vehicle and some space between vehicles.  This average vehicle distance means that for each second of time, 3 metres of vehicle-equivalents can be moved through the intersection.  

Box 9.4 provides a sample calculation of the required spacing between two intersections.

Box 9.4 Calculating vehicle queues between intersections

The following scenario is outlined in order to determine whether two intersections will result in free-flow operation or in congestion:

D12 = Distance between intersection 1 and intersection 2
      = 100 metres

Tg 1 = Green phase time at intersection 1
       = 40 seconds per phase

Tg 2 = Green phase time at intersection 2
       = 30 seconds per phase

To determine if the distance between these intersections is sufficient, Equation 9.12 can be applied:

D12 < 3 * Max ( Tg1, Tg2 )

100 metres < 3 * 40 = 120 metres

Since 100 metres is less than the required 120 metres, there is not enough space between the intersections.  It is therefore possible that vehicles queuing at the second light will back-up onto the first intersection.   Since intersection 1 has a green phase of 40 seconds, some 20 vehicles will clear the intersection.  As each vehicle on average consumes 6 metres of longitudinal space, 120 metres of vehicles will form a queue at the second intersection.   If the intersection is only 100 metres away, then the queue will spill over into the first intersection and disrupt the functioning of the first traffic light.
