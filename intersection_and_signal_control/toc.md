# Intersections and traffic signals

**A bland smile is like a green light at an intersection, it feels good when you get one, but you forget it the moment you're past it.** -Douglas Coupland, novelist, 1961--            

 BRT Standard: Intersection treatments | POINTS

Some turns prohibited across the busway and some signal priority | 3 
No turns prohibited across the busway but signal priority at most or all intersections |  2
No turns prohibited across the busway but some intersections have signal priority | 1

### Chapter overview

The objective of this chapter is to equip the reader with tested practical knowledge to design and evaluate the layout and operation of intersections along BRT corridors. Intersections can cause significant delay in BRT operations by hindering stations and are the points where the BRT project has the most perceived impact on mixed traffic and walking.

An important strategy to improve the performance of intersections to better accommodate public transport, pedestrians and other vehicles is to restrict general-traffic turning movements. The BRT Standard awards up to 6 points for good handling of BRT movements through intersections, with the most points given to systems which prohibit all turns across the busway. 

Besides the above, this chapter also discusses the placement of stations relative to intersections along the corridor and the treatment of public transport vehicle turning movements, which are desirable, but equally harms intersections performance. Signal technology to provide priority to public transport, design for BRT priority in roundabouts, solutions for narrow sections and requisites to improve safety and convenience to pedestrians and cyclists are discussed too.

Definitions that permeate the whole chapter are laid out in the first section, the second section sets the general approach to intersection problem solving and the next sections discuss different tools to improve intersections efficiency. Finally all the above is discussed when grade separation is available.

	24.4 Restricting General Traffic Turning Movements

        £1. - Optimise handling demand X optimise speed (should be maximise)
            - What is best for achieving demand
            - Stations and intersection are some of the main focal points (quite repetitive)
            (not exactly emphasizing intersections as possible operational disruption)
            - In signalized- intersections capacity is determined by:
                - movements allowed
                - vehicle volumes in the intersection
                - necessary green time to each movement throughput (<--in fact is only this)
            - Removing movements translates in more green time.
            - Optimizing intersections should be about reduce intersections and simplify movements that are impossible to eliminate (<-- impossible is too strong...)

		    (this as well as grade separation are needing introduction
		
        24.4.1 Evaluating Need for Turning Movement Restrictions
            
            -  standard technique for increasing BRT travel speeds and reducing signal delay is to restrict as many mixed-traffic turning movements across the corridor as possible (<--repetition of previous)
            - If the busway is reaching saturation, or the introduction of the BRT system increases mixed-traffic saturation to critical levels, it becomes imperative to consider some form of turning restrictions with the objective of achieving an ideal two-phase intersection. (<-- ideal was not explained)

            (This subsubsection does not address the evaluation of need for restriction, evaluation should be addressed or subsubsection eliminated... an introductory text about signal phases, should be considered)

        24.4.2 Alternatives for Restricting General Traffic Movements

        £1-6 6 options are presented (1 and 3 are the same and option 6 is a variant of 2), described and schematic drawn
        
        (need to clarify some draws and reorder)

        £7. 
        - There are other options combining the above.
        - Consider adjacent streets have capacity to absorb additional traffic.
        - residential areas will encounter resistance to such changes 

        (would notice that residential areas rarely have congested intersections)

        £8. 
        - Alternatives to restrict turns are:
            (1) separated turning lanes
            (2) pre-signal to BRT to queue jump
            (3) grade separation (<-- this is not)

        (Neither of this is about restrict turns, but about how to enable them with less disruption)
