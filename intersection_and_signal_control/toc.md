# Intersections and traffic signals

**"A bland smile is like a green light at an intersection, it feels good when you get one, but you forget it the moment you're past it."** -Douglas Coupland, novelist, 1961--

### Chapter overview

The objective of this chapter is to equip the reader with tested practical knowledge to design and evaluate the layout and operation of intersections along BRT corridors. Intersections can cause significant delay in BRT operations -- particularly by hindering stations -- and are the points where the BRT project has the most perceived impact on mixed traffic and walking.

An important strategy to improve the performance of intersections to better accommodate public transport, pedestrians and other vehicles is to restrict general-traffic turning movements at intersections. The BRT Standard awards up to 6 points for good handling of BRT movements through intersections, with the most points given to systems which prohibit all turns across the busway. 

Besides the above, this chapter also discusses the placement of stations relative to intersections along the corridor and the treatment of public transport vehicle turning movements, which are desirable, but equally harms intersections performance.Technology to provide public transport vehicles with priority, priority in roundabouts, narrow sections with mixed traffic, and techniques to provide safety to pedestrians and cyclists are discussed too

Definitions that permeate the whole chapter are laid out in the first section, the second section sets the general approach to intersection problem solving and the next sections discuss different tools to improve intersections efficiency. Finally all the above is discussed when grade separation is available.
