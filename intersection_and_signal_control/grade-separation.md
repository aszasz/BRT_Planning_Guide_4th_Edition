## Grade Separation
*“Conflict can and should be handled constructively; when it is, relationships benefit. Conflict avoidance is _not_ the hallmark of a good relationship. On the contrary, it is a symptom of serious problems and of poor communication.”* ― Harriet B. Braiker, psychologist, expert on stress management, 1948-

Grade-separation brings many benefits from the perspective of travel time savings by raising intersection capacity for both BRT vehicles and mixed traffic vehicles. But the infrastructure can be costly, depending on local circumstances.  In many instances, the time savings to BRT passengers and to private vehicles will fully justify the added infrastructure costs, but limited capital resources will typically constrain infrastructure expenditures.  

### Criteria for grade separation

In all of our BRT studies to date we have never really had to resort to a single flyover, meaning that there were always solutions to guarantee BRT operations that would reduce overall current travel times with the available space. In other words: without resorting to grade-separation, solutions are likely to be found where the advantages to public transport passengers are greater than prejudices to private vehicle users. Besides that, a corridor project usually have to deal with existing flyovers.

Nonetheless, when the capacity of a 4-phase intersection is reaching saturation (more than 600 vehicles/lane/hour), it is fairly typical for engineers to suggest the construction a flyover or an underpass that allows straight movement for one main road (2 of the 12 movements), while all other movements remain at the same level. Such general inclination often leads towards a political understanding that flyovers constructions along the BRT corridor are necessary.

The introduction or existence of flyovers or underpasses in the corridor requires special treatments for BRT systems, but they represent an opportunity to dramatically improve BRT vehicle operation.  Exclusive busway use of a flyover is a successful technique used in several existing BRT systems despite its potential major adverse visual impacts, which are highly undesirable from an aesthetics standpoint, in cities and urban areas.

An ideal separated-grade solution should let remain only low intensity intersections (low enough to not require traffic lights) If it removes mixed-traffic and BRT intersections, then it is best to keep BRT at the grade where access is facilitated, likely to be street-level with at-grade crossing.

If the grade separation solution will not eliminate all conflicts, the first option is to use grade separation infrastructure to BRT usage and exclusively for BRT use if needed.

While the discussion in this section is concentrated on flyovers as a means of grade separation, underpasses are frequently the preferred option from an aesthetics standpoint. Generally the cost of a busway on a flyover will be at least ten times the cost of a normal at-grade busway. The cost of a busway in an underpass will be similar to that of a flyover unless there are adverse subsurface conditions such as the presence of services (utilities), high water tables and hard rock conditions that may result in underpasses not being technically feasible or economically viable.


### Station location with grade separated solutions

If the grade-separated design solution maintains BRT lane through intersections, same concerns about queue blocking the stations apply.

When BRT lane is grade separated, hindering the station is not a concern, but effective pedestrian access becomes a major issue.

In most instances, grade-separation will imply placing the stations more than three hundred meters away from the tunnel or overpass.  This siting restriction will add walking time for customers travelling between the station and the intersection, which crossing street is likely to abridge key destinations.  The Quito Central Norte line uses grade separation quite effectively with tunnels whisking BRT vehicles through congested intersection locations.  However, the tunnels also imply that at important destinations, such as the Plaza de las Américas (Plaza of the Americas), the closest station is a considerable distance away (Figure quito-under-roundabout-bad-station-location).  Thus, for the likely high number of customers from/to this busy area, the time savings from the grade-separation can be essentially lost due to the longer walk.

As an alternative to obtain intersection efficiency (with time savings that serve all passengers through the section) at the cost of convenient station location (that serves local-specific passengers), it is possible to place the station beneath or above the intersection. Many underground metro stations utilise station siting in this manner.  The Metro Center station of the Washington Metro exits directly into the basement floors of commercial shops.  In such cases, though, accessing ground-level shops and offices will require a grade transfer for customers, implying either stairs, escalators, and/or elevators.
Both the Brisbane and Ottawa BRT systems site stations at the tunnel level.  In Brisbane, the station is just before the tunnel and thus provides good customer access to local destinations (Figure Brisbane-station-before-tunnel).  In Ottawa, the station connects directly to a commercial shopping centre (Figure Ottawa-station-inside-tunnel).  Further, in the case of Ottawa, the tunnel station nicely protects customers from the harsh winter temperatures. Quito also has achieved great success with its Villa Flora station that goes beneath a heavily-trafficked roundabout on Maldonado Avenue (Figure quito-under-roundabout-good-station-location).

Effective pedestrian access as well as visually neutral solutions can be designed. For TransMilenio Phase II’s “Avenida Boyacá” station along the Avenida Suba Corridor, the adopted solution was to locate the station above Avenida Boyacá, level with the flyover. Pedestrians access the platform via an elevator from a small pedestrian plaza where fares are collected. This solution allowed for the strategic location of this station, which will make future transfer points on the projected Av. Boyacá closer from each other. Ultimately, the implementation of solutions of this sort will depend on budgetary constraints.

### Restricting turning movements together with grade-separation

As said in introduction to this section, unless all vehicle-intersections are eliminated from the BRT lane by the separated-grade solution, the first option is to consider grade separation infrastructure to be used by the BRT. In such cases, concern is determine if cost of separated-grade station are justified by the users of that station time-savings and can be afforded. This cost is the infrastructure and/or the time losses generated to private vehicle users that will loose a second or a third lane on the separated-grade infrastructure (and if it can be politically afforded by the project too).

A second possibility is to allow the BRT vehicles to also pass over the flyover in mixed traffic (see \secnum(Merging with mixed traffic), that will result in stations being far from the intersections. Additionally, this configuration can be particularly problematic if there is a connecting BRT corridor running on the perpendicular street below the flyover or above the underpass.  

The third possibility is when the flyover built on the road perpendicular to the BRT corridor.  In this case, the flyover does not introduce any special difficulty in relation to the (same-level) intersection already discussed and if it cannot eliminate the intersection with mixed-traffic, it can certainly alleviate the intensity and the number of conflicts, increasing the BRT green time.

The last possibility ais that the fly-over is let for mixed traffic alone an BRT remain on the street level. As the others don't create intersection with BRT, this fourth possibility is the only of interest for the reminder of this subsection (all four must be considered when evaluating benefits though).

If a single flyover in the median is built, the BRT vehicles in the median will have to cross the mixed traffic going over the flyover. This scenario creates either the need for a new signalised intersection prior to the flyover, or a merging lane where the BRT buses and mixed traffic can cross, introducing possible delay and confusion for both the BRT system and the mixed traffic.  Figure \fignum(fly-over-conflict) shows the conflict.

![fly-over-conflict](img/fly-over-conflict.png "Schematic of Delhi roadway in which BRT vehicles must cross mixed traffic that is attempting to access a flyover. Image courtesy of Elebeta.")

If two separate access for the flyover, one for each traffic direction, are constructed, it is possible leave a space between them for the BRT system to continue along the surface as in figure \fignum(no-fly-over-conflict).

![no-fly-over-conflict](img/fly-over-conflict.png "Alternative design for fly-over that allow BRT vehicles proceed without conflicts to the area bellow the fly-over. Image courtesy of Elebeta.")

In this configuration, the BRT will intersect the crossing street under the flyover, so we must consider the alternatives of section \secnum(Restricting mixed-traffic turns) also with the introduction of the fly-overs to reduce the number of phases.


Option “H” shows the limited benefit of using a flyover or underpass if the BRT lanes remain at the surface level and four-phase signal timing is maintained (Figure 9.17).  In this scenario, the overall increase in intersection capacity is quite small with the capacity only rising from 600 pcu/lane/hour to 700 pcu/lane/hour.

Option “H” is fairly common with conventional bus services in cities such as Bangkok (Figure 9.18).  Mixed traffic vehicles have access to the flyover and thus are given a substantial priority at the intersection.  By contrast, public transport vehicles servicing the intersection area are often mired in heavy congestion.  

Figure 9.17 Option “H”.

Figure 9.18 While mixed traffic vehicles can bypass a congested intersection in Bangkok, public transport vehicles are often consigned to serving stations near the intersection.  The result can be slow average speeds for public transport.  Photo by Lloyd Wright.

Option “I” is typical along a proposed BRT corridor in Guangzhou.  In this case, all straight movement is relocated to the flyover.  As a result, the number of signal phases for intersection on the surface is reduced to three (Figure 9.19). For this option, capacity increases marginally to 800 pcu/lane/hour.

Figure 9.19 In option “I”, the presence of a flyover handling all the straight vehicle movement in one direction (both mixed traffic vehicles and BRT vehicles), reduces the number of surface level phases to three.

Options “J” and “K” combine grade-separation infrastructure with limitations on turning movements.   Thus, options “J” and “K” essentially replicate many of the turning movements from option “D” but with the added benefit of grade separation in some directions.  In some cases, this combination may necessitate off-ramps from the flyover in order to facilitate certain turning movements (Figure 9.20).  The combination of these configurations dramatically increases the intersection’s potential capacity.  Option “J” is capable of delivering a capacity of 1,600 pcu/lane/hour while option “K” produces a capacity of 2000 pcu/lane/hour.


Figure 9.20 Combining grade separation with limitations on turning movements can produce intersection capacities as high as 2,000 pcu/lane/hour.

While both flyover and underpass options are presented here, underpasses are frequently a preferred option from a standpoint of aesthetics.  The proliferation of flyovers within a city environment can do much to scar an area’s visual image.  However, in cases where the road base is hard bedrock, underpass construction may be prohibitively expensive.  Likewise, if an area possesses a high water table, then an underpass may not be technically viable or desirable.  

This section has highlighted the idea that on any BRT corridor there are generally critical intersections where the addition of the new BRT system will create conditions nearing saturation.  If full four-phase signalisation is maintained in such conditions (options “A”, “B”, “H”, or “I”), then congestion is a likely result.  The best solutions tend to involve restrictions on turning movements plus, in some cases, grade separation.  Typically, turning restrictions and grade separation are far more effective in maximising intersection capacity than signal prioritisation or green-wave signal phasing.  

Any intersection, though, cannot be analysed in isolation.  Optimum results are usually obtained when vehicle movements are not only analysed at the particular intersection but also along the corridor and the entire extended area close to the intersection.

### BRT turning with grade separated solutions

Another alternative is to provide the dedicated turns through grade separated infrastructure. For heavy traffic corridors where free-flow turning is required to avoid breaking-down the system, the time savings certainly justify the costs.

Bogotá utilises grade separation both to provide dedicated turning infrastructure to BRT operations: overpasses and underpasses links corridors of 80th Street and Norte-Quito-Sur to an exclusive BRT roundabout (Figure NQS-80th-roundabout-photo and Figure NQS-80th-roundabout-topview) and a superlative BRT only third-floor roundabout completed in 2015 to guarantee that the interchange in Norte-Quito-Sur and Calle 6 has no delays (Figure construction-superlative-TransM-roundabout.jpg andfigure

### BRT through roundabouts with grade separated solution

Construct a busway underpass that goes below the roundabout and avoids all conflicts with mixed traffic -- and thus promoting time savings for both BRT and mixed traffic -- is also a possibility, as the examples from Quito with good and bad station locations shows (Figure quito-under-roundabout-bad-station-location and Figure quito-under-roundabout-good-station).

![villa-flora-roundabout](img/villa-flora-quito-top.png "Quito's BRT avoids Vila Flora roundabout traffic with underpasses. Image from Google Earth.")

A fly-over is also a possibility, but the design of an aesthetically acceptable solution is very challenging. With the exception of the superlative third floor roundabout above mixed-traffic roundabout of Bogotá mentioned in the previous section, there is no other project we have heard of.
