### Chapter overview

The objective of this chapter is to equip the reader with the best practice tools required to design the layout and operation of intersections along the proposed BRT corridors. Intersections can cause significant delay in BRT operations by hindering stations and are the points where the BRT project has the most perceived impact on mixed traffic and walking.

An important strategy to improve the performance of intersections to better accommodate public transport and other vehicles is to restrict general-traffic turning movements at intersections. The BRT Standard awards up to 6 points for good handling of BRT movements through intersections, with the most points given to systems which prohibit all turns across the busway. 

Besides the above, this chapter also discusses the placement of stations relative to intersections along the corridor and the treatment of public transport vehicle turning movements, which are desirable, but equally harms intersections performance.  Traffic-signal technology to provide public transport vehicles with priority and techniques to provide safety to pedestrians and cyclists are discussed too.

## Introduction

### About intersections

Intersection is the area where two or more roads encounter each other. 
The use of the word in Traffic Engineering technical environment implies in "roads for vehicles" and "at the same level",
but very often the expressions "at-grade intersections" or "single grade intersections" are used to confirm the concept;
for fly-overs and underpasses the term used is "interchange" or still "separated-grade interchange".
When more than one mode is involved, the common traffic engineers wording is "crossing", 
and one of the road is assumed to be a "carriageway", as in  "pedestrian crossing"; recently the term "multimodal intersection" has been applied.  

By this definition, intersection implies in conflicts for vehicles to use the same space,
and can refer to an unidirectional T-shaped or Y-shaped confluence area;
the conflicts there gets clear when there is no space to accommodate the two incoming
flows on the exiting stream in a congested situation.

![high volume in an Y-shaped intersection](img/crowded-Y-junction.png  "a Y junction that is an intersection")

Conversely a channelled Y-shaped junction may not be an intersection.

![channelled Y-shaped intersection](img/chanelled-Y-junction.png "a chanelled Y junction that is not an intersection" )

Considering the majority of cases of two or more roads meetings where there are many possible turning movements -- not all conflicting, intersections can be seen as several adjacent intersections as well. 

Once footpaths (or "roads for people") are more important to accessibility in populated areas, carriageways are usually constructed between footpaths. When two carriageways encounter, several walkways crossings are adjacent. So, a multimodal intersection encompasses a larger area where people conflict to use the same space. For clearance, let us remember that drivers and passengers are people.

The higher the number of conflicts in an intersection or in a crossing, higher is the time people will need to cross it safely.

If the frequency of vehicles arrivals at the intersection -- pedestrians and vehicles at a crossing -- is low, eventual passage negotiating is enough to maintain safety without compromising travel time.

If over the years the vehicle frequencies along the day rise to the point where queues happen often and last long or the time required to pedestrians to cross safely becomes too long is the moment to intervene.

An interference is justified by the comparing the present value of costs for its implementation, maintenance and operation against the value of its benefits, of which the most easier to establish are the time savings assuming a safe operation and does directly related to it (as fuel consumption and pollution).

Interventions start with zebras and yielding signs. Channelling the vehicles and creating refuge islands is a manner to clearly divide an intersection in the several smaller intersection components, improving traffic safety and reducing the overall delay; roundabouts or mini-roundabouts are ways to channel vehicles as well. Above a certain point, traffic lights are required, that may grow really complex in order to accommodate all conflicts; then traffic diversion and restricting direct movements come at play... until the grade separation becomes necessary.

Ideally a separated-grade traffic solution eliminates intersections, but in practice, due to space restrictions, intersections eventually remain.

### Approach to intersection design

BRT systems are generally built on corridors where mixed traffic congestion is already a problem, or where congestion is likely to occur in the near future, otherwise there would be no benefit of building a segregated busway.  The worse the congestion appears, the greater the benefit of the exclusive busway (Figure congested-intersection.jpg) If a BRT system makes public transport services better but mixed traffic worse, it will be less politically successful than if it makes public transport better and also improves mixed traffic flow.  BRT system planners therefore generally try to minimise adverse impacts on mixed traffic.

![separated-grade solutions with remaining intersections ](img/congested-intersection.jpg "The introduction of BRT and design changes to poorly controlled and congested intersections often leads to efficiency improvements for both public transport vehicles and mixed traffic.  Photo by Lloyd Wright.")

Even intersections alone are usually less critical than stations,   they represent a critical point along any BRT corridor (Figure 24.1). A poorly designed intersection or a poorly timed signal phase can substantially reduce system capacity and speed, specially by hindering stations. Finding solutions to optimizing intersection performance can do much to improve system efficiency. Generally, the three main objectives of intersection design along a BRT corridor are to:

1. Provide safe and convenient crossings for pedestrians;
2. Minimize delay for BRT vehicles;
3. Minimize delay for mixed traffic.

Walking trips and walking part of trips collect travel time improvements from these objectives, but it should be noticed that, even pedestrians safety and accessibility have the highest priority and some methods -- specially for station access and location  -- take into account pedestrian times to analyse alternatives, the approach discussed here still do not equalize pedestrians by inputting delays into the process. Current procedure mostly try to "fit" demand needs into the available space so pedestrians can do all crossings safely, buslane queues are not long enough to block stations and car desired are still possible, without worsening congestion. Keep in mind that if public and private transport users' times were equalized, every street with one bus carrying 50 passengers each two minutes would have an exclusive bus lane.

![pedestrians-crossing-corridor](img/pedestrians-crossing-corridor.jpg "Intersection design affects the BRT system’s efficiency, pedestrian safety and access, and flows of mixed traffic vehicles. Photo by Lloyd Wright.")

It is generally not advisable to use a standard intersection configuration throughout a BRT corridor. Rather, it is best to design the intersection for the specific conditions at the given location. The impact of a planned BRT system on overall intersection performance is often a significant consideration when deciding on a service plan for the BRT system, the location of the stations, and the design of the stations.

BRT system planners have used the following tools to rationalize intersections: 

- Simplify the BRT system’s routing structure to optimize turning movements into the corridor;
- Restrict as many mixed-traffic turning movements on the BRT corridors as possible;
- Optimize the location of the station relative to adjacent intersections;
- Optimize the signal phasing and consider signal priority for public transport vehicles.

Every decision and solution proposed during the intersection design process should be technically supported by the elaboration of a comprehensive traffic study, where classified and directional flow counts are carried out at every active intersection (signalized or not) along the corridor being designed. This is necessary to diagnose the current performance of each intersection and forecast a future scenario incorporating the operational changes a BRT corridor might bring. 

## Basic Concepts

The basic concepts we present here are mostly related to understanding the equations related to delay and queues sizes in signalized intersections, without intention to be a complete reference about it. For basic concepts the reader may want to further investigate the concepts of traffic density and traffic headway, and how they relate with traffic average speed and traffic flow. We provide further references for traffic signals in the bibliography

Before that, we emphasize that when applying formulas, attention should be given to units and units conversions, as the appropriate dimension to perceive phase times in traffic lights or the time to walk or ride a few blocks is seconds while we better perceive speeds in kilometres or miles per hour. It is useful to remember that 1 hour is the same as 3600 seconds and one mile is approximately 1.6 kilometres and 1 kilometre is approximately 0.6 miles.

### i-turn and o-turn

For this chapter we excluded the expressions right-turn and left-turn as they have different meanings in different hand-way systems. We choose to adopt the i-turn and o-turn. We chosen this cryptic words instead of more explanatory expressions like "against-opposite-flow-exit-turn" so it can be short in the text; and we choose it against shorter and less explanatory expressions as "inside-turn" or "central-turn" to force the reader look for this concepts here, instead of assuming a less clear meaning or be left in doubt.


*i-turn*: a vehicle movement to exit the current traffic stream direction that requires crossing the flow in the opposite way. If a busway or a bike lane is present near the medium, there is also conflict the BRT vehicles or bicycles going straight in the same way as in opposite way.

*o-turn*: a vehicle movement to exit the current traffic stream direction that normally does not cross any vehicle flow. This movement conflicts with people on the side walk in both ways and if the road abridges curb-side busway or a curbside bike-lane, there is conflict with that traffic as well.

*u-turn* (this is the usual concept, included here only for completeness, as this is not always obvious for non-native speakers): a vehicle movement to join  the traffic stream in the opposite way of the direction it is current flow. Depending on the width of the medium this movement can be less conflicting than the i-turn or more conflicting as the speed has to be lower. This movement is sometimes moved away from the intersection where other movements are allowed, creating another intersection exclusively for it. Due to road geometry restriction or other considerations, this movement eventually is channelized to start from a waiting area from the curb-side of the road, in which case it will conflict with both flows in the same way a i turn from a perpendicular street would.

![turns-example-right-hand](img/right-side-driving-turns.png "Example of i-turn \(green car\), o-turn\(blue car\), u-turn without space \(red car\), u-turn with space \(pink car\) for right driving way as in China, US, Brazil and Continental Europe")
![turns-example-left-hand](img/left-side-driving-turns.png "Example of i-turn \(green car\), o-turn\(blue car\), u-turn without space \(red car\), u-turn with space \(pink car\) for left driving way as in India, Indonesia, South-Africa, Tanzania, Australia and UK")

### Speed

For application with the concepts outlined in this chapter, speed, to which we use the letter V from the synonymous velocity, is the average traffic speed of all vehicles in a segment. It would be measured by the mean time all vehicles crossing the segment divided by the segment extension. Under our modelling intents (that is capacity evaluation) it can be imagined that all vehicles are moving in that speed.

Still matching the broader concept of speed -- the ratio of motion expressed in distance per unit of time -- it is useful to remember that given a segment length (D_segment, for distance), knowing the speed (V_segment) is equivalent of knowing the travel time (Time_segment) through the segment and vice-versa, as the equivalent equations show:

V_segment = D_segment / Time_segment  <-->  Time_segment = D_segment / V_segment

### pcu

A passenger-car unit, or pcu is a reference used to bring different vehicle types to a common denominator. The conversion factor from a certain type of vehicle to a passenger car unit depends of application intended after the conversion, being eventually calibrated for an specific use in an specific situation (for example if stress upon the pavement or congestion potential is considered, if such is in urban environment or in a highway, in a ramp or in plain terrain).

In any case, a motorcycle for example tends to have an equivalent of less than one vehicle, and a mini-bus is equivalent to more than one vehicle, the larger and heavier the vehicle, higher the equivalence is.

### Flow 

Traffic engineering borrow concepts from fluid mechanics and uses "flow rate" as a measure traffic intensity.
From that definition, the word "rate" is commonly dropped and "flow" alone becomes treated as physical quantity expressed by the number of vehicles crossing a transversal section (or cross-section, like a stop line) during a certain time interval. Flow is usually represented by letter q in equations, but we will avoid that here and use the full word instead.

It should be noted the use the word "volume" to express the same idea is accepted even it is conceptually even more far from the original definition (fluid mechanics original comparative term would be "volume flow rate" even "mass flow rate" is more appropriated reference as the same number of vehicles can be compressed); volume should refer to total number of vehicles in the same way litres refers to volume and litres/second refers to flow in hydraulics. The term is specially common in the expression "volume/capacity ratio", which makes particular sense.

### Capacity and Saturation 

The capacity (flow rate) of a segment is given by the lower capacity of a section within it, the term "bottleneck" for the lower-capacity-section express this concept quite clearly.

The capacity of a section by its turn is defined as the maximum flow a section can handle under prevailing use. It is subject to the number of lanes, width of lanes, ramp inclination, the use of surrounding areas --  as parking and stopping regulations, presence of intersection or traffic light ahead, bus stops existence and frequencies and  cultural driving behaviours.

Capacity can be easily and objectively measured, but some of the influential factors cannot. Many models have been developed to improve forecast of road capacity based on the knowledge of design and use of surrounds and even the more detailed simulators needs careful calibration to correctly represent driver behaviours changes, that tend to be unique to each place.

The simpler models commonly don't fit exactly to theories either and are usually adjusted by experimental evidence. These resort to the concept of *basic saturation*.

Basic saturation (flow rate) is the capacity for a section of a given standard ideal carriageway, divided by number of lanes of that given standard carriage way.

Capacity and speed are inter-dependent and the maximum flow does not happens when speeds are maximum. This happens due to the fact that the distance a driver maintains from the vehicle in front of it raises more than proportionally than the speed increase. The speed maximum capacity occurs in a section of unconstrained road is between 60 and 80 kph (km/hour).

Capacity models then define a way to forecast a *saturation flow* multiplying the basic saturation flow by adjustment factors to account for various non-ideal geometric, traffic, and environmental conditions of a given section, such as number of lanes, lane width, heavy vehicles, grade, parking facilities, bus blockage, area type, turning traffic along the segment, radius of turnings, pedestrian crossing traffic, but not considering traffic lights.

Saturation (flow rate), therefore, is the capacity of a section that is not under the influence of traffic light; for section that approach the traffic light, saturation is the capacity assuming a constant green, which would equal to the flow observed during the queueing discharge. For this reason saturation maybe called discharge (flow rate).

A practical rule, even distorting a bit the concept of ideal conditions is that: for urban environments, the basic saturation of a lane is 1800 pcu/hour. For the purpose of capacity measuring an 18-metres-articulated bus is equivalent to 2.5 car-passengers-unit. So in a busway, the basic saturation per lane is 720 articulated-bus/hour.

### Continuity

Although no direct formula application about continuity is used in this chapter, one basic equation of an intersection is that all the flow into the intersection has to exit the intersection.

### Traffic signal and traffic signal times

Traffic lights are a very common intersection management tool in business district areas where the BRT corridor design is likely to face the more challenging problems. Traffic lights controllers can be coordinated and actuated (use detection) by more or less complex technology and algorithms, a lot of research and development have been made in the last 30 years, but its use is relatively limited. The concepts presented in this chapter are useful to understand BRT design requirements to program traffic lights, be it on simpler controllers or as policy delimiters to more complex systems.

Traffic lights eliminate some of the negotiations between vehicles on arrival, by determining which movements may proceed at a given moment. Traffic lights may allow conflicting movements, usually not all of them intense; pedestrian crossing the transversal street is commonly one of them. By reducing negotiations, traffic light prevents that all vehicles approaching the intersection reduce their speeds, and the time each vehicle spends on the intersection itself and increasing the throughput and safety.


###### Phase

One set of movements that are allowed to occur at the same time is called a signal phase. It should be noted that some movements are allowed during several phases;in many countries, allowing o-turns at all times is the standard. Some writers, ourselves eventually included, may use expressions like "allowing a particular turn in the beginning of  phase two" when technically it should be "adding a short phase before phase 2 where particular turn will be allowed". 

###### Effective green time (T_green)

The phase duration (or length) refers to its "effective green" time, which is the time vehicles doing the movement considered are effectively moving, which may start a little after the green light is given and end in the middle of yellow lights (where such is used), or in the first moments of red (clearance interval). For this chapter, where queueing and intersection capacity is evaluated, green time means "effective green" time.

###### Cycle time (T_cycle)

Excluding situations where special phases are activated by detectors, the traffic signals on an intersection repeats the order of the phases successively in cycles. The cycle time can be measured as the time between the green light is given to a movement till the next time it is given to that movement again (after it has changed to red once). In this chapter, "cycle time" alone refers to a traffic light cycle time (route cycle times are not discussed).

###### Red time (T_red)

For the interest of intersection capacity and queueing evaluation, red time means cycle time minus (effective) green time

###### Lost time and traffic light plans

In the same way as intersections in general, the higher the number of turning movements in a intersection with traffic lights, higher is the difficult to serve them all. Some movements can happen simultaneously, some cannot. Reducing the number of phases implies that the number of lanes of the approaches to allowed movements on any phase will be higher and the intersection will have an overall higher throughput ([see section](restricting-turns)) 

The optimal phase times in a signalized intersection is such that the cycle time is as brief as possible without forming queues. The problem to be dealt with is that every phase change there is a considerable *lost time* between the end of the effective green of a phase and the start of the next. Lost times depends both of the signal programming, enforcement policy, and driver behaviour and the longer the lost times results in safer the intersections. This is an additional reason to restrict the number of phases. 

Unlikely infrastructure, that must be sized based on the peak use and eventually become underused in other times of the day. Traffic signal timing plans for peak moments would lead to unnecessary delays at other moments of the day. Traffic light plans, should change along the day as demand changes; one extreme application example is shutting down (yellow blinking) a signal late night and early morning.

![traffic-lights-diagram](img/traffic-light-stages.png "flow and queue formation during traffic light phases")

Traffic signals programming shall change along the day

### Delay

Delay is the additional travel time, if not explicit, the base reference is the travel time without any conflicts, in an ideal situation where the passenger, pedestrian or driver is the only user of the road (no other drivers, pedestrians users or traffic lights).

### Intersection capacity

In the right perspective for this chapter analysis, intersection capacity refers to the entrance section (the stop line) of a road segment under study.

Considering the definition of intersection as the area where vehicles come into conflict, the capacity of the intersection should be measured as the total number of (equivalent) vehicles that crossed it not caring for the movements. But in this chapter the analysis refers to the section 


Similarly to most of other design decisions that affect infrastructure needs, intersection design, should be made considering the peak conditions, but unlikely station infrastructure and intersection design, traffic time timing that minimizes travel time in on 

and to represent the peak we both use and measure the busiest hour of the day (as a reminder: we survey data with smaller intervals than on hour, so a given measure of busiest hour might have happened from 7:15 AM to 8:15 AM for example).

## Station location relative to the intersection


## Evaluating intersections

### Corridor audits


### Traffic sign impacts

### Closing intersections

Sometimes, intersections are too close together in order to optimise the station location relative to the intersection.  In such instances, an assessment has to be made in terms of how important the station location is for boarding and alighting passengers.  If it is an important location, the time savings benefits for pedestrians of locating a station close to this destination must be weighed against the likelihood time lost within the BRT system due to interference between the station and the intersection.   If there are no important destinations in that location, it is better not to locate a station there.  

Mixed traffic vehicles will most likely be able to pass through the two intersections using a synchronised signalisation system.  However, the same may not be true for BRT vehicles.  Instead, the BRT vehicle will pass through the green phase at the first intersection and then stop at the station for passenger boarding and alighting.  By the time the vehicle resumes movement towards the second intersection the signal phase may well have changed to red (Figure 9.48).  Thus, this configuration may lead to considerable delay for public transport passengers.

Figure 9.48 While mixed traffic vehicles may benefit from a synchronised green phase between two intersections, BRT passengers may encounter the red phase at the second intersection.

Even for normal mixed traffic, having two intersections too close together will sometimes lead to problems.  Vehicles queued at one intersection will back up to the point where vehicles are unable to clear the previous intersection during a green phase.   Equation 9.12 defines the calculation for the distance at which this type of conflict may occur.

Equation 9.12 Calculating the distance at which intersection conflicts occur

D12 < 3 * Max ( Tg1, Tg2 )

Where:

D12 = Distance between intersection 1 and intersection 2

Tg1 = Green signal time per phase cycle at intersection 1 

Tg2 = Green signal time per phase cycle at intersection 2

A mixed traffic lane can generally handle 1,800 vehicles per hour.  This quantity translates to two vehicles per second (3,600 seconds in an hour).  When vehicles are stopped at a stop light, the average amount of space they take up is 6 metres; this space includes the vehicle and some space between vehicles.  This average vehicle distance means that for each second of time, 3 metres of vehicle-equivalents can be moved through the intersection.  

Box 9.4 provides a sample calculation of the required spacing between two intersections.



## Grade Separation

“Look at all the buses now that want exact change, exact change. I figure if I give them exact change, they should take me exactly where I want to go.”
George C. Wallace

Grade-separation brings many benefits from the perspective of travel time savings by raising intersection capacity for both BRT vehicles and mixed traffic vehicles. But the infrastructure can be costly, depending on local circumstances.  In many instances, the time savings to BRT passengers and to private vehicles will fully justify the added infrastructure costs, but limited capital resources will typically constrain infrastructure expenditures.  

### Criteria for grade separation

In all of our BRT studies to date we have never really had to resort to a single flyover, meaning that there were always solutions to guarantee BRT operations that would reduce overall current travel times with the available space. In other words: without resorting to grade-separation, solutions are likely to be found where the advantages to public transport passengers are greater than prejudices to private vehicle users. Besides that, a corridor project usually have to deal with existing flyovers.

Nonetheless, when the capacity of a 4-phase intersection is reaching saturation (more than 600 vehicles/lane/hour), it is fairly typical for engineers to suggest the construction a flyover or an underpass that allows straight movement for one main road (2 of the 12 movements), while all other movements remain at the same level. Such general inclination often leads towards a political understanding that flyovers constructions along the BRT corridor are necessary. 

The introduction or existence of flyovers or underpasses in the corridor requires special treatments for BRT systems and they represent an opportunity to dramatically improve BRT vehicle operation.  Exclusive busway use of a flyover is a successful technique used in several existing BRT systems despite its potential major adverse visual impacts, which are highly undesirable from an aesthetics standpoint, in cities and urban areas.

Thus, the first option is to consider grade separation infrastructure to be dedicated to BRT usage.

While the discussion in this section is concentrated on flyovers as a means of grade separation, underpasses are frequently the preferred option from an aesthetics standpoint. Generally the cost of a busway on a flyover will be at least ten times the cost of a normal at-grade busway. The cost of a busway in an underpass will be similar to that of a flyover unless there are adverse subsurface conditions such as the presence of services (utilities), high water tables and hard rock conditions that may result in underpasses not being technically feasible or economically viable.


### Station location with grade separated solutions

If the grade-separated design solution maintains BRT lane through intersections, same concerns about queue blocking the stations apply for the traffic signal times on surface level. 

When BRT lane is grade separated, hindering the station is not a concern, but effective pedestrian access becomes a major issue.

In most instances, grade-separation will imply placing the stations away from the tunnel or overpass.  This siting restriction will add walking time for customers travelling between the station and the intersection, which crossing street is likely to abridge key destinations.  The Quito Central Norte line uses grade separation quite effectively with tunnels whisking BRT vehicles through congested intersection locations.  However, the tunnels also imply that at important destinations, such as the Plaza de las Américas (Plaza of the Americas), the closest station is a considerable distance away (Figure quito-under-roundabout-bad-station-location).  Thus, for the likely high number of customers from/to this busy area, the time savings from the grade-separation can be essentially lost due to the longer walk.

![quito-under-roundabout-bad-station-location](img/quito-under-roundabout-bad-station-location "In the case of Quito’s Central Norte line, the presence of an BRT underpass has meant that the closest station to a key destination, the Plaza of Américas commercial centre, is several hundred metres away.  Photo by Lloyd Wright.")

As an alternative to obtain intersection efficiency (with time savings that serve all passengers through the section) at the cost of convenient station location (that serves local-specific passengers), it is possible to place the station beneath or above the intersection. Many underground metro stations utilise station siting in this manner.  The Metro Center station of the Washington Metro exits directly into the basement floors of commercial shops.  In such cases, though, accessing ground-level shops and offices will require a grade transfer for customers, implying either stairs, escalators, and/or elevators.
Both the Brisbane and Ottawa BRT systems site stations at the tunnel level.  In Brisbane, the station is just before the tunnel and thus provides good customer access to local destinations (Figure Brisbane-station-before-tunnel).  In Ottawa, the station connects directly to a commercial shopping centre (Figure Ottawa-station-inside-tunnel).  Further, in the case of Ottawa, the tunnel station nicely protects customers from the harsh winter temperatures. Quito also has achieved great success with its Villa Flora station that goes beneath a heavily-trafficked roundabout on Maldonado Avenue (Figure quito-under-roundabout-good-station-location). 

![Brisbane-station-before-tunnel](img/brisbane-station.jpg "Placing stations just before a BRT tunnel as in Brisbane helps customers with comfortable access to local destinations. Photo courtesy of Queensland Transport.")

Effective pedestrian access as well as visually neutral solutions can be designed. For TransMilenio Phase II’s “Avenida Boyacá” station along the Avenida Suba Corridor, the adopted solution was to locate the station above Avenida Boyacá, level with the flyover. Pedestrians access the platform via an elevator from a small pedestrian plaza where fares are collected. This solution allowed for the strategic location of this station, which will make future transfer points on the projected Av. Boyacá closer from each other. Ultimately, the implementation of solutions of this sort will depend on budgetary constraints.

### Restricting turning movements together with grade-separation

A second possibility is when the flyover is built on the road perpendicular to the BRT corridor.  In this case, the flyover does not introduce any special difficulty and can help to alleviate  a BRT intersection and increase green phase time.

If a single flyover in the median is built for mixed traffic while BRT buses are forced to use surface streets, the buses in the median must cross the mixed traffic going over the flyover.  This problem is being confronted in Delhi.  This scenario creates either the need for a new signalised intersection prior to the flyover, or it requires a merge lane where the BRT buses and mixed traffic can cross, introducing possible delay and confusion for both the BRT system and the mixed traffic.  Figure 9.16 shows the conflict in a planned BRT system in Delhi where it must cross a mixed-traffic only flyover.  Clearly, in this scenario, it would be far better to dedicate the flyover (or at least the middle lanes of the flyover) to the BRT system.

Figure 9.16 Schematic of Delhi roadway in which BRT vehicles must cross mixed traffic that is attempting to access a flyover.

A third possibility is to construct two separate flyovers, one for each traffic direction, leaving a space between the flyover for the BRT system that allows BRT buses to continue along the surface. 

Figure New draw for 3rd possibility.

A fourth possibility is to allow the BRT vehicles to also pass over the flyover, either in a segregated lane, or if there is no space for a segregated lane, then in mixed traffic.  This last option sometimes results in stations being far from intersections, which may produce inconvenience for passengers seeking to reach destinations near the intersection.  Additionally, this configuration can be particularly problematic if there is a connecting BRT corridor running on the perpendicular street below the flyover or above the underpass.  

Option “H” shows the limited benefit of using a flyover or underpass if the BRT lanes remain at the surface level and four-phase signal timing is maintained (Figure 9.17).  In this scenario, the overall increase in intersection capacity is quite small with the capacity only rising from 600 pcu/lane/hour to 700 pcu/lane/hour.
If a single flyover in the median is built for mixed traffic while BRT buses are forced to use surface streets, the buses in the median must cross the mixed traffic going over the flyover.  This problem is being confronted in Delhi.  This scenario creates either the need for a new signalised intersection prior to the flyover, or it requires a merge lane where the BRT buses and mixed traffic can cross, introducing possible delay and confusion for both the BRT system and the mixed traffic.  Figure 9.16 shows the conflict in a planned BRT system in Delhi where it must cross a mixed-traffic only flyover.  Clearly, in this scenario, it would be far better to dedicate the flyover (or at least the middle lanes of the flyover) to the BRT system.

Option “H” is fairly common with conventional bus services in cities such as Bangkok (Figure 9.18).  Mixed traffic vehicles have access to the flyover and thus are given a substantial priority at the intersection.  By contrast, public transport vehicles servicing the intersection area are often mired in heavy congestion.  

Figure 9.17 Option “H”.

Figure 9.18 While mixed traffic vehicles can bypass a congested intersection in Bangkok, public transport vehicles are often consigned to serving stations near the intersection.  The result can be slow average speeds for public transport.  Photo by Lloyd Wright.

Option “I” is typical along a proposed BRT corridor in Guangzhou.  In this case, all straight movement is relocated to the flyover.  As a result, the number of signal phases for intersection on the surface is reduced to three (Figure 9.19). For this option, capacity increases marginally to 800 pcu/lane/hour.

Figure 9.19 In option “I”, the presence of a flyover handling all the straight vehicle movement in one direction (both mixed traffic vehicles and BRT vehicles), reduces the number of surface level phases to three.

Options “J” and “K” combine grade-separation infrastructure with limitations on turning movements.   Thus, options “J” and “K” essentially replicate many of the turning movements from option “D” but with the added benefit of grade separation in some directions.  In some cases, this combination may necessitate off-ramps from the flyover in order to facilitate certain turning movements (Figure 9.20).  The combination of these configurations dramatically increases the intersection’s potential capacity.  Option “J” is capable of delivering a capacity of 1,600 pcu/lane/hour while option “K” produces a capacity of 2000 pcu/lane/hour.


Figure 9.20 Combining grade separation with limitations on turning movements can produce intersection capacities as high as 2,000 pcu/lane/hour.

While both flyover and underpass options are presented here, underpasses are frequently a preferred option from a standpoint of aesthetics.  The proliferation of flyovers within a city environment can do much to scar an area’s visual image.  However, in cases where the road base is hard bedrock, underpass construction may be prohibitively expensive.  Likewise, if an area possesses a high water table, then an underpass may not be technically viable or desirable.  

This section has highlighted the idea that on any BRT corridor there are generally critical intersections where the addition of the new BRT system will create conditions nearing saturation.  If full four-phase signalisation is maintained in such conditions (options “A”, “B”, “H”, or “I”), then congestion is a likely result.  The best solutions tend to involve restrictions on turning movements plus, in some cases, grade separation.  Typically, turning restrictions and grade separation are far more effective in maximising intersection capacity than signal prioritisation or green-wave signal phasing.  

Any intersection, though, cannot be analysed in isolation.  Optimum results are usually obtained when vehicle movements are not only analysed at the particular intersection but also along the corridor and the entire extended area close to the intersection.

### BRT turning with grade separated solutions

Another alternative is to provide the dedicated turns through grade separated infrastructure. For heavy traffic corridors where free-flow turning is required to avoid breaking-down the system, the time savings certainly justify the costs.

Bogotá utilises grade separation both to provide dedicated turning infrastructure to BRT operations: overpasses and underpasses links corridors of 80th Street and Norte-Quito-Sur to an exclusive BRT roundabout (Figure NQS-80th-roundabout-photo and Figure NQS-80th-roundabout-topview) and a superlative BRT only third-floor roundabout completed in 2015 to guarantee that the interchange in Norte-Quito-Sur and Calle 6 has no delays (Figure construction-superlative-TransM-roundabout.jpg andfigure

### BRT through roundabouts with grade separated solution

Construct a busway underpass that goes below the roundabout and avoids all conflicts with mixed traffic -- and thus promoting time savings for both BRT and mixed traffic -- is also a possibility, as the examples from Quito with good and bad station locations shows (Figure quito-under-roundabout-bad-station-location and Figure quito-under-roundabout-good-station).

A fly-over is also a possibility, but the design of an aesthetically acceptable solution is very challenging. With the exception of the superlative third floor roundabout of Bogotá mentioned in the previous section, there is no other project we have heard of.
