### Chapter overview

The objective of this chapter is to equip the reader with the best practice tools required to design and evaluate the layout and operation of intersections along the proposed BRT corridors. Intersections can cause significant delay in BRT operations by hindering stations and are the points where the BRT project has the most perceived impact on mixed traffic and walking.

An important strategy to improve the performance of intersections to better accommodate public transport and other vehicles is to restrict general-traffic turning movements at intersections. The BRT Standard awards up to 6 points for good handling of BRT movements through intersections, with the most points given to systems which prohibit all turns across the busway. 

Besides the above, this chapter also discusses the placement of stations relative to intersections along the corridor and the treatment of public transport vehicle turning movements, which are desirable, but equally harms intersections performance.  Traffic-signal technology to provide public transport vehicles with priority and techniques to provide safety to pedestrians and cyclists are discussed too.

## Introduction

### About intersections

Intersection is the area where two or more roads encounter each other. The use of the word in Traffic Engineering technical environment implies in "roads for vehicles" and "at the same level", but very often the expressions "at-grade intersections" or "single grade intersections" are used to confirm the concept; for fly-overs and underpasses the term used is "interchange" or still "separated-grade interchange". When more than one mode is involved, the common traffic engineers' wording is "crossing" -- one of the roads is assumed to be a "carriageway" -- as in  "pedestrian crossing"; recently the term "multimodal intersection" has been applied.  

By this definition, intersection implies in conflicts for vehicles to use the same space,and can refer to an unidirectional T-shaped or Y-shaped confluence area; the conflicts there gets clear when there is no space to accommodate the two incoming flows on the exiting stream in a congested situation.

![high volume in an Y-shaped intersection](img/crowded-Y-junction.png  "a Y junction that is an intersection.")

Conversely a channelled Y-shaped junction may not be an intersection.

![channelled Y-shaped intersection](img/chanelled-Y-junction.png "a chanelled Y junction that is not an intersection.")

Considering the majority of cases of two or more roads meetings where there are many possible turning movements -- not all conflicting, intersections can be seen as several adjacent intersections as well; i.e., an intersection is a larger conflict area that is composed of smaller conflict areas (=smaller intersections).

Once footpaths (or "roads for people") are more important to accessibility in populated areas, carriageways are usually constructed between footpaths. When two carriageways encounter, several walkways crossings are adjacent. So, a multimodal intersection encompasses a larger area where people conflict to use the same space. For clearance, let us remember that drivers and passengers are people.

The higher the number of conflicts in an intersection or in a crossing, higher is the time people will need to cross it safely.

If the frequency of vehicles arrivals at the intersection -- pedestrians and vehicles at a crossing -- is low, eventual passage negotiating is enough to maintain safety without compromising travel time.

If over the years the vehicle frequencies along the day rise to the point where queues happen often and last long or the time required to pedestrians to cross safely becomes too long is the moment to intervene.

An intervention is justified by the comparing the present value of costs for its implementation, maintenance and operation against the present value of its benefits, of which the most easier to establish are the time savings assuming a safe operation and the costs directly related to it (as fuel consumption and pollution).

Interventions start with zebras and yielding signs. Channelling the vehicles and creating refuge islands is a manner to clearly divide an intersection in several smaller intersection components, improving traffic safety and reducing the overall delay; roundabouts or mini-roundabouts are ways to channel vehicles as well. Above a certain point, traffic lights are required and they may grow in really complex ways to accommodate all conflicts; then traffic diversion and restricting direct movements come at play... until the grade separation becomes necessary.

Ideally a separated-grade traffic solution eliminates intersections, but in practice, due to space restrictions, intersections eventually remain.

![separated-grade solutions eliminate intersections](img/sep-grade-no-conflict.png "Separated-grade solutions may eliminate intersections.")

![separated-grade solutions with remaining intersections ](img/sep-grade-solution.png "Separated-grade solutions may not eliminate intersections.")

### Approach to intersection design

BRT systems are generally built on corridors where mixed traffic congestion is already a problem, or where congestion is likely to occur in the near future, otherwise there would be no benefit in building a segregated busway.  The worse the congestion appears, the greater the benefit of the exclusive busway (Figure congested-intersection.jpg) If a BRT system makes public transport services better but mixed traffic worse, it will be less politically successful than if it makes public transport better and also improves mixed traffic flow.  BRT system planners therefore generally try to minimise adverse impacts on mixed traffic.

![congested-intersection ](img/congested-intersection.jpg "The introduction of BRT and design changes to poorly controlled and congested intersections often leads to efficiency improvements for both public transport vehicles and mixed traffic.  Photo by Lloyd Wright.")

Even intersections alone are usually less critical than stations, they represent a critical point along any BRT corridor. A poorly designed intersection or a poorly timed signal phase can substantially reduce system capacity and speed, specially by hindering stations. Finding solutions to optimizing intersection performance can do much to improve system efficiency. Generally, the three main objectives of intersection design along a BRT corridor are to:

1. Provide safe and convenient crossings for pedestrians;
2. Minimize delay for BRT vehicles;
3. Minimize delay for mixed traffic.

Walking trips and walking part of trips collect travel time improvements from these objectives, but it should be noticed that, even pedestrians safety and accessibility have the highest priority and some methods -- specially for station access and location  -- take into account pedestrian times to analyse alternatives, the approach discussed here still do not equalize pedestrians by inputting delays into the process. Current procedures mostly try to "fit" demand needs into the available space so pedestrians can do all crossings safely, buslane queues are not long enough to block stations and car desired movements are still possible, without worsening congestion. Keep in mind that if public and private transport users' times were equalized, every street with one bus carrying 50 passengers each two minutes would have an exclusive bus lane.

![pedestrians-crossing-corridor](img/pedestrians-crossing-corridor.jpg "Intersection design affects the BRT system’s efficiency, pedestrian safety and access, and flows of mixed traffic vehicles. Photo by Lloyd Wright.")

It is generally not advisable to use a standard intersection configuration throughout a BRT corridor. Rather, it is best to design the intersection for the specific conditions at the given location. The impact of a planned BRT system on overall intersection performance is often a significant consideration when deciding on a service plan for the BRT system, the location of the stations, and the design of the stations.

BRT system planners have used the following tools to rationalize intersections: 

- Simplify the BRT system’s routing structure to optimize turning movements into the corridor;
- Optimize the number of intersections along the corridor;
- Restrict as many mixed-traffic turning movements on the BRT corridors as possible;
- Optimize the location of the station relative to adjacent intersections;
- Optimize the signal phasing and consider signal priority for public transport vehicles.

Every decision and solution proposed during the intersection design process should be technically supported by the elaboration of a comprehensive traffic study, where classified and directional flow counts for cars and pedestrians are carried out at every active intersection (signalized or not) along the corridor being designed. This is necessary to diagnose the current performance of each intersection and forecast a future scenario incorporating the operational changes a BRT corridor might bring. 

## Basic Concepts

The basic concepts we present here are mostly related to understanding the equations related to delay and queues sizes in signalized intersections, without intention to be a complete reference about it. For basic concepts the reader may want to further investigate the concepts of traffic density and traffic headway, and how they relate with traffic average speed and traffic flow. We provide further references for traffic signals in the bibliography.

Before that, we emphasize that when applying formulas, attention should be given to units and units conversions, as the appropriate dimension to perceive phase times in traffic lights or the time to walk or ride a few blocks is seconds while we better perceive speeds in kilometres or miles per hour. It is useful to remember that 1 hour is the same as 3600 seconds and one mile is approximately 1.6 kilometres and 1 kilometre is approximately 0.6 miles.

### General concepts

###### cross-traffic-turn and kerb-side-turn

For this chapter we have excluded the expressions right-turn and left-turn as they have different meanings in different hand-way systems. We have chosen to adopt cross-traffic and kerb-side-turn instead.

*cross-traffic-turn*: a vehicle movement to exit the current traffic stream direction that requires crossing the flow in the opposite way. If a busway or a bike lane is present near the medium, there is also conflict the BRT vehicles or bicycles going straight in the same way as in opposite way.

*kerb-side-turn*: a vehicle movement to exit the current traffic stream direction that normally does not cross any vehicle flow. This movement conflicts with people on the side walk in both ways and if the road abridges curb-side busway or a curbside bike-lane, there is conflict with that traffic as well.

*u-turn* (this is the usual concept, included here only for completeness, as this is not always obvious for non-native speakers): a vehicle movement to join  the traffic stream in the opposite way of the direction it is current flow. Depending on the width of the medium this movement can be less conflicting than the cross-traffic-turn or more conflicting as the speed has to be lower. This movement is sometimes moved away from the intersection where other movements are allowed, creating another intersection exclusively for it. Due to road geometry restriction or other considerations, this movement eventually is channelized to start from a waiting area from the curb-side of the road, in which case it will conflict with both flows in the same way a cross-traffic-turn from a perpendicular street would.

![turns-example-right-hand](img/right-side-driving-turns.png "Example of cross-traffic-turn \(green car\), kerb-side-turn\(blue car\), u-turn without space \(red car\), u-turn with space \(pink car\) for right driving way as in China, US, Brazil and Continental Europe")
![turns-example-left-hand](img/left-side-driving-turns.png "Example of cross-traffic-turn \(green car\), kerb-side-turn\(blue car\), u-turn without space \(red car\), u-turn with space \(pink car\) for left driving way as in India, Indonesia, South-Africa, Tanzania, Australia and UK")

###### Speed

For application with the concepts outlined in this chapter, speed, to which we use the letter V from the synonymous velocity, is the average traffic speed of all vehicles in a segment. It would be measured by the mean time all vehicles crossing the segment divided by the segment extension. Under our modelling intents (that is capacity evaluation) it can be imagined that all vehicles are moving in that speed.

Still matching the broader concept of speed -- the ratio of motion expressed in distance per unit of time -- it is useful to remember that given a segment length (D_segment, for distance), knowing the speed (V_segment) is equivalent of knowing the travel time (Time_segment) through the segment and vice-versa, as the equivalent equations show:

![Equation: Speed](img/eq-speed-definition.png "V_segment = {D_segment} over {Time_segment}  dlarrow  Time_segment = {D_segment} over {V_segment}") 

###### Delay

Delay is the additional travel time, if not explicit, the base reference is the travel time without any conflicts, in an ideal situation where the passenger, pedestrian or driver is the only user of the road (no other drivers, pedestrians users or traffic lights).

###### pcu

A passenger-car unit, or pcu is a reference used to bring different vehicle types to a common denominator. The conversion factor from a certain type of vehicle to a passenger car unit depends of application intended after the conversion, being eventually calibrated for an specific use in an specific situation (for example if stress upon the pavement or congestion potential is considered, if such is in urban environment or in a highway, in a ramp or in plain terrain).

In any case, a motorcycle for example tends to have an equivalent of less than one vehicle, and a mini-bus is equivalent to more than one vehicle, the larger and heavier the vehicle, higher the equivalence is.

###### Flow 

Traffic engineering borrow concepts from fluid mechanics and uses "flow rate" as a measure traffic intensity.
From that definition, the word "rate" is commonly dropped and "flow" alone becomes treated as physical quantity expressed by the number of vehicles crossing a transversal section (or cross-section, like a stop line) during a certain time interval. Flow is usually represented by letter q in equations, but we will avoid that here and use the full word instead.

It should be noted the use the word "volume" to express the same idea is accepted even it is conceptually even more far from the original definition (fluid mechanics original comparative term would be "volume flow rate" even "mass flow rate" is more appropriated reference as the same number of vehicles can be compressed); volume should refer to total number of vehicles in the same way litres refers to volume and litres/second refers to flow in hydraulics. The term is specially common in the expression "volume/capacity ratio", which makes particular sense.

![eq-vehicle-flow](img/eq-flow-definition.png "Flow_vehicles = {Number_vehicles} over {Time}") 

Flow can also be expressed for pedestrians, bicycles or even passengers

###### Capacity and Saturation  

The capacity (flow rate) of a segment is given by the lower capacity of a section within it, the term "bottleneck" for the lower-capacity-section express this concept quite clearly.

The capacity of a section by its turn is defined as the maximum flow a section can handle under prevailing use. It is subject to the number of lanes, width of lanes, ramp inclination, the use of surrounding areas --  as parking and stopping regulations, presence of intersection or traffic light ahead, bus stops existence and frequencies and  cultural driving behaviours.

Capacity can be easily and objectively measured, but some of the influential factors cannot. Many models have been developed to improve forecast of road capacity based on the knowledge of design and use of surrounds and even the more detailed simulators needs careful calibration to correctly represent driver behaviours changes, that tend to be unique to each place.

The simpler models commonly don't fit exactly to theories either and are usually adjusted by experimental evidence. These resort to the concept of **basic saturation**.

Basic saturation (flow rate) is the capacity for a section of a given standard ideal carriageway, divided by number of lanes of that given standard carriage way, it is commonly expressed by "s0"
Capacity and speed are inter-dependent and the maximum flow does not happens when speeds are maximum. This happens due to the fact that the distance a driver maintains from the vehicle in front of it raises more than proportionally than the speed increase. The speed maximum capacity occurs in a section of unconstrained road is between 60 and 80 kph (km/hour).  
Based on extensive observations, capacity models then define a way to forecast a **saturation flow** multiplying the basic saturation flow by adjustment factors to account for various non-ideal geometric, traffic, and environmental conditions of a given section, such as number of lanes, lane width, heavy vehicles, grade, parking facilities, bus blockage, area type, turning traffic along the segment, radius of turnings, pedestrian crossing traffic, but not considering traffic lights.

Saturation is commonly written as S in equations, but here we use "SaturationFlow" or "SatFlow" to avoid confusion with saturation level,usually "X" that represents the relation between demand and capacity for a given infrastructure element as an intersection or a station.

![equation-saturation-model-definition](img/eq-mod-sat-flow.png "SaturationFlow = basicsaturationflowperlane * NLanes * (f_geometry * f_traffic * f_parking * f_truning * f...) ")

Saturation (flow rate), therefore, is the capacity of a section that is **not** under the influence of traffic light; for section that approach the traffic light, saturation is the capacity assuming a constant green, which would equal to the flow observed during the queueing discharge. For this reason saturation maybe called discharge (flow rate). When working in an specific location, saturation of sections can be measured, so the resulting product of all this factors is known.

A practical rule, even distorting a bit the concept of ideal conditions is that: for urban environments, the observed saturation of a lane is 1800 pcu/hour. For the purpose of capacity measuring an 18-metres-articulated bus is equivalent to 2.5 car-passengers-unit. So in a busway, the saturation per lane is 720 articulated-bus/hour.

![equation-saturation-definition](img/eq-sat-flow.png "SatFlow = CapFlow_awayfromintersection = saturationflowperlane * NLanes ") 


###### Continuity

Although no direct formula application about continuity is used in this chapter, one basic equation of an intersection is that all the flow into the intersection has to exit the intersection.

### Traffic signal and traffic signal times

Traffic lights are a very common intersection management tool in business district areas where the BRT corridor design is likely to face the more challenging problems. Traffic lights controllers can be coordinated and actuated (use detection) by more or less complex technology and algorithms, a lot of research and development have been made in the last 30 years, but its use is relatively limited. The concepts presented in this chapter are useful to understand BRT design requirements to program traffic lights, be it on simpler controllers or as policy delimiters to more complex systems.

Traffic lights eliminate some of the negotiations between vehicles on arrival, by determining which movements may proceed at a given moment. Traffic lights may allow conflicting movements, usually not all of them intense; pedestrian crossing the transversal street is commonly one of them. By reducing negotiations, traffic light prevents that all vehicles approaching the intersection reduce their speeds, and the time each vehicle spends on the intersection itself and increasing the throughput and safety.

###### Phase

One set of movements that are allowed to occur at the same time is called a signal phase. It should be noted that some movements are allowed during several phases;in many countries, allowing o-turns at all times is the standard. Some writers, ourselves eventually included, may use expressions like "allowing a particular turn in the beginning of  phase two" when technically it should be "adding a short phase before phase 2 where particular turn will be allowed". 

###### Effective green time (T_green)

The phase duration (or length) refers to its "effective green" time, which is the time vehicles doing the movement considered are effectively moving, which may start a little after the green light is given and end in the middle of yellow lights (where such is used), or in the first moments of red (clearance interval). For this chapter, where queueing and intersection capacity is evaluated, green time means "effective green" time.

###### Cycle time (T_cycle)

Excluding situations where special phases are activated by detectors, the traffic signals on an intersection repeats the order of the phases successively in cycles. The cycle time can be measured as the time between the green light is given to a movement till the next time it is given to that movement again (after it has changed to red once). In this chapter, "cycle time" alone refers to a traffic light cycle time (route cycle times are not discussed). ###### Red time (T_red)

###### Red time (T_red)

For the interest of intersection capacity and queueing evaluation, red time means cycle time minus (effective) green time

###### Lost time and traffic light plans

In the same way as intersections in general, the higher the number of turning movements in a intersection with traffic lights, higher is the difficult to serve them all. Some movements can happen simultaneously, some cannot. Reducing the number of phases implies that the number of lanes of the approaches to allowed movements on any phase will be higher and the intersection will have an overall higher throughput ([see section](restricting-turns)) 

The optimal phase times in a signalized intersection is such that the cycle time is as brief as possible without forming queues. The problem to be dealt with is that every phase change there is a considerable **lost time** between the end of the effective green of a phase and the start of the next. Lost times depends both of the signal programming, enforcement policy, and driver behaviour and the longer the lost times results in safer the intersections. This is an additional reason to restrict the number of phases. 

Unlikely infrastructure, that must be sized based on the peak use and eventually become underused in other times of the day. Traffic signal timing plans for peak moments would lead to unnecessary delays at other moments of the day. Traffic light plans, should change along the day as demand changes; one extreme application example is shutting down (yellow blinking) a signal late night and early morning.

![traffic-lights-diagram](img/traffic-light-stages.png "For each approach, during effective green, flow starts at saturation until queue dissolves, off effective green time there is queue formation, lost time happens when neither approach has flow.")

Traffic signals programming shall change along the day, so green, red and cycle times must change based on different programmings for the time of the day (week and season too) and, where available, based on traffic detection applied to parameters in the programming for that moment. Se when we discuss these features as fixed, we must understand it as the limiting parameters for the traffic controller that allow adaptive changes based on detection.

We look to design infrastructure associated with traffic light plan to the peak-hours of the day for each flow, if there is enough capacity at this moments, certainly will be in others, although traffic signal programs need to be different to minimize travel times. To represent the peak we both use and measure the busiest hour of the day for the given flow (as a reminder: we survey data with smaller intervals than on hour, so a given measure of busiest hour might have happened from 7:15 AM to 8:15 AM for example).

### Intersection capacity

Considering the definition of intersection as the area where vehicles come into conflict, the capacity of the intersection should be measured as the total number of (equivalent) vehicles that crossed it adding up all the movements.

But in the right perspective for this chapter analysis, intersection capacity refers to the entrance section (the approach or stop line) of a road segment under study. Furthermore, we are particularly interested in signalized intersections, assuming that the corridor where the BRT is placed has preference at smaller unsignalized intersections that don't cause meaningful delay to mixed-traffic or to BRT.

###### Relative green (K_green)

The proportion of time that the flow to a given approach can cross the intersection.

![equation-relative-green-definition](img/eq-rel-green.png "K_green = {T_green} over {T_cycle} ")

###### Relative red (K_red)

The proportion of time that traffic is hold in a given approach.

![equation-relative-red-definition](img/eq-rel-red.png "K_red = {T_red} over {T_cycle}")

 By the relation of this definition and that of red time, <img src="img/eq-red+green.png" alt="T_red = T_cycle - T_green" height="16">, we can conclude that <img src="img/eq-kred+kgreen.png" alt="K_red+K_green =1 " height="32"> and therefore:

![equation-relative-red-definition-to-relative-green](img/eq-kred-kgreen.png "K_red = 1 - K_green")

![equation-relative-green-definition-to-relative-red](img/eq-kgreen-kred.png "K_green = 1 - K_red")


###### Capacity at signalized intersection approach

It is simply the saturation flow of the approach times the proportion of time it is in operation. Unless stated otherwise, intersection capacity refers to this.

![equation-intersection-capacity-definition](img/eq-cap-inter-flow.png "CapFlow_intersection = saturationflowperlane * NLanes * K_green ")

The capacity away from the intersection can be considered by this definition, if one assumes that K_green is equal to one, i.e., an uninterrupted flow.

![equation-capacity-definition](img/eq-cap-flow.png "CapFlow = saturationflowperlane * NLanes * K_green ")



## Station location relative to the intersection

*“The engineer's first problem in any design situation is to discover what the problem really is.”*
	-	Anonymous

Intersection and station design should minimize the added travel time of the all the customers. The station location in relation to the intersection will affect BRT system flow and speed, pedestrian travel times, and the right-of-way needed for the BRT system. Because conditions vary from intersection to intersection, it is generally advisable to find an optimal solution for each intersection rather than to presume a single solution will always be optimal. The greater amount of information the planning team has available regarding movements and demand, specially pedestrians destinations, the easier it will be to evaluate alternatives, finding an optimal solution for all modes of transport for the existing restrictions.

### Station location possibilities

The following station locations are possible: 

- At the intersection:
    
    - For side aligned stations, station can be either nearside or far side, i.e. before or after the intersection in each direction;
    - For median stations, if not split, station will be near side in one direction and far side in the other;

- Away from the intersection;
    
    - near the intersection;
    - far from the intersection (or mid-block);

- Under or over the intersection.

###### At intersection

The normal justification for putting the bus stop at the intersection is that it reduces walking times for passengers with destinations or transferring on the crossing street. 

Unless the red time is really short is bellow 20 seconds and station saturation (discussed on Chapter 7) is really low, the resulting saturation of the conjunct intersection + station (i.e. the BRT vehicle will occupy the area with two functions: queue-box waiting for green light and boarding area) will be greater than one and lead to congestion that will end only after the peak (figure \numfig SaoPaulo-spillback). Such a situation clearly will not be compensated by reducing passengers walking times, not even to passengers that will alight on that station and certainly not to all passengers that must only cross that intersection. 

Additionally, such justification is often based in presumptions and rarely based on data, only micro-level destination maps based on surveys can effectively quantify walking time benefits of station location relative to the intersection. Furthermore, large number of transferring passengers should be addressed when route service planning is designed.

In the rare case the station must be located at the intersection, there is an emerging consensus that before the intersection location is preferable, in split platform configurations, if the BRT lane is near the median.

![SaoPaulo-spillback](img/FariaLima.jpg "Buses waiting for traffic light after boarding and alighting is completed block station in São Paulo, today this is station is moved back. Photos by Arthur Szász")

###### Away from the intersection


**Stations should in general be around one hundred meters from intersections.** 

As highlighted above and as discussed in the remainder of this section, there should be some space between the intersection and the station as it:
- provides the possibility of take away mixed-traffic space without change road capacity for the section
- prevents that bus queues at the intersection from hindering the station

We further divide the possibility of location in relation to the intersection in "near it" and "far from it" (or "mid-block"). The aspect to be taken into consideration for this dichotomy is the passenger access to the station.

Mid-block-stations will require access infrastructure not shared nor closely related with the intersection pedestrian crossings. In the typical environment discussed here,i.e., a station located between mixed-traffic signalized intersections, signalized at-grade options is the likely ideal solution. But such solution introduces a new intersection (considering the multimodal definition of it) that needs to be taken into account when evaluating capacity both of the station and of mixes traffic.

We should remember that a crossing for access will be required to curb-side mid-block stations as well.



![Delhi-station-layout](img/Delhi-station-layout-3ed9.46.png "In this proposed road layout for Delhi, the mid-block BRT stations are given additional right-of-way.and several access points. At the intersections, right-of-way for mixed traffic vehicles is maximised.  Image courtesy of ITDP.")

###### Above or bellow the intersection

This alternative is discussed at the section \sectionnumber(Grade Separation), where other aspects of graded-separated solutions are presented.



### Minimum mixed-traffic number of lanes away from the intersection that does not affect segment capacity

Usually the mixed-traffic bottleneck is the intersection, where capacity is fifty to thirty percent  (proportional to the green fraction of each approach) of mid-block capacity. So if BRT stations are far from intersections, the general-traffic road capacity can be reduced in its surroundings without any significant impact on the capacity and performance on the segment as a whole. This means that mixed-traffic lanes can be removed, and  its space given to the BRT station,  thus enabling the widening  required for BRT at stations to accommodate passing lanes, and hence provide high capacity at stations without impacting mixed-traffic capacity atall (Figure Soul-wide-station).

For example, at the bus stop, if bus frequencies are high and an overtaking lane is needed at each station, the extra width required will be around 12 metres.  If the station is located at the intersection, these 12 metres will be difficult to supply while also providing 6 metres turn lanes for mixed traffic.  Separating these functions will allow the same right of way to be used for the bus station at mid-block, and for left and right turn signals at the intersection. Figure Delhi-station-layout shows an application of this concept within a proposal for the Delhi BRT system. 

![Seoul-wide-station](img/Seoul-wide-station.jpg "A mid-block station location in Seoul allows greater right-of-way width for the station area.  Photo courtesy of the City of Seoul.")




Once capacity in a given control section (CapFlow) is expressed by:

![equation-capacity-definition](img/eq-cap-flow "CapFlow = saturationflowperlane * NLanes * Time_green/Time_cycle")

where:
CapFlow:Capacity of the evaluated section of control, usually in pcu/hour;
flowperlane_saturation: saturation flow of one lane (in "ideal conditions", around 1800 in urban areas pcu/hour);
Time_green / Time_cycle: relative (effective) green time, that we may also call K_green
NLanes: total  number of available lanes;

One can evaluate the possibility of narrowing mixed-traffic road away from intersection without affect the capacity of the segment, by assuring that capacity away from intersection (where relative green time can be considered 1 or 100%) is greater than capacity in the intersection; 

FlowCap_away >= FlowCap_intersection

saturationflowperlane * NLanes_away * 1.0 >= saturationflowperlane * NLanes_intersection * Time_green-away/ Time_cycle-away

NLanes_away >=  NLanes_intersection * Time_green/ Time_cycle

Examples:

- if near intersection mixed traffic has 3 lanes (NLanes_away=3), and relative green time is 60% (Time_green/ Time_cycle = 0.6), then far from intersection (Nlanes_away) can be 2 lanes without affecting the segment performance:

NLanes_away >=  3 * 0.6 = 1.8

- if near intersection mixed traffic has 2 lanes (NLanes_away=2), and relative green time is 50% (Time_green/ Time_cycle = 0.6), then far from intersection (Nlanes_away) can be only one lane without affecting the segment performace:

NLanes_away >=  2 * 0.5 = 1.0

- If we are planning a mid-block station with signalized crossing access, the green time for traffic mid-block over the cycle time has to be included in the equation:

NLanes_away >= NLanes_intersection * 


### Minimum Recommended Distance between the BRT Station and the Intersection from mixed-traffic perspective

NOTICE: THIS DISTANCE IS FOR THE DESIGN OF STATIONS THAT TAKES AWAY MIXED-TRAFFIC LANES, NARROWING THE AVAILABLE SPACE FOR CARS AWAY FROM THE INTERSECTION ASSURING THAT MIXED-TRAFFIC CAPACITY DOES NOT GET AFFECTED!

Away from the signalized intersection means far enough to guarantee that the capacity flow in the intersection can last all the green phase. This is equivalent to assure that the queueing space  with the same number of lanes of the intersection approach has enough capacity to hold all vehicles that can cross the intersection in the duration of the green phase.

This means the distance from intersection (Dist_station-intersection) has to be longer than the space between to queueing vehicles times the number of vehicles that will cross the retention line in one lane.

Considering that a saturation flow per lane (saturationflowperlane) of 1800 pcu/hour is equivalent to one vehicle each two seconds (across the intersection in one lane) and the distance between (the front of) two vehicles (length_pcu) is 5 meters, this means that for each second of the green phase the queue will be 2.5 meters short.

Queue discharge rate = flow_saturation/lenght_pcu

Another way to think about this is that the “speed of the shock-wave” starting at the retention line after the traffic-signal opens is 2.5 metres per second, i.e., the second car behind (5 meters behind) will start to move 2 seconds after the first, the third car behind (10 meters from the retention line) will move after 4 seconds and so on...

Velocity_discharge-shock-wave = flow_saturation/lenght_pcu

Therefore the distance between station and intersection (Dist_station-intersection) has to be equal or greater than the distance the shock-wave can move during the duration green phase (T-gree); representing the speed of shock-wave by Vel_shock-wave, this can be expressed as:

Dist_station-intersection >= V_shock-wave * Time_green

Using meters and seconds for the measures we have:

Dist_station-intersection[in metres] >= 2.5 * Time_green[in seconds]

Examples:

If green time is 40 seconds, the station must be at least 100 meters from the intersection, equal the length of queue discharged during the green time 

Dist_station-intersection[in metres] >= 2.5 * 40 = 100

If green time is 90 seconds, the station must be at least 225 meters from the intersection, equal the length of queue discharged during the green time 

Dist_station-intersection[in metres] >= 2.5 * 90 = 225

### Minimum Recommended Distance between the BRT Station and the Intersection from BRT perspective

Another compelling reason for separating the station location and the intersection is that it minimizes the risk that BRT vehicles will be backed up at the station, which will inhibit the functioning of the intersection and the functioning of the station. If these two potential bottlenecks are co-located, the risk of mutual interference between the station and the intersection increases. Consequently, it is advised to include a safety buffer in the station design for those stations to be located near a signalized intersection. This additional length will temporarily hold buses that: (1) in case of a blockage have cleared the station but are forced to queue up at the intersection until the conflict is resolved, or (2) have cleared the station during the red phase and have to wait for the green cycle (Figures \fignum station-spillback and \fignum intersection-spillback).This buffer should also be around one hundred meters, as the following equations show.

This problem is still serious in “open” BRT systems without clearly designated stopping bays, as bus queueing can be longer than the platform. Besides that, such systems chaotic boarding process not only creates stress for the customer but it also increases boarding times (Figure \fignum Taipei-spillback).

![intersection-spillback](img/intersection-spillback-3ed9.43.png "For the direction of the BRT system that stops at the station before the intersection, there is a risk that vehicles will be delayed due to the signal phase. Diagram courtesy of ITDP.")

![station-spillback](img/station-spillback-3ed9.44.png "For the direction of the BRT system that stops after the intersection, there is a risk that vehicles create a back-up into the intersection and block traffic. Diagram courtesy of ITDP.")

![Taipei-spillback](img/Taipei-spillback.jpg "For the direction of the BRT system that stops after the intersection, there is a risk that vehicles create a back-up into the intersection and block traffic. Diagram courtesy of ITDP.")


The buffer size (Dist_station-intersection) should be the space required by queuing BRT vehicles. 

Dist_station-intersection >= N_bus * Length_bus

where:

Length_bus: Average length of lane space consumed by the queuing BRT vehicles; adding two values:
 - Length of the BRT vehicle and 
 - Length of space between BRT vehicles when stopped (usually assumed to be 1 metre)

N_bus: Likely number to queue during the red phase (T_red) of traffic signal, discussed bellow.

Assuming BRT vehicle frequencies (Freq_bus) are bellow 50% from the BRT lane saturation flow (SaturationFlow_bus) -- that is practically always, as this represents 360 articulated buses per hour, that would carry more than 40 thousand passengers per hour per direction -- N_bus, which is equivalent to the height of the upper graphic in figure \fignum traffic-lights-diagram, can be determined by

N_bus = T_red * Freq_bus / (1 - Freq_Bus / SaturationFlow_bus) 

Example utilising typical data of an average city in India:

T_red = 50 seconds (or 50/3600 hours to use consistent units = 1/72 hour);
Freq_bus = 200 articulated-buses /  hour (equivalent to 1 bus each 18 seconds);
SaturationFlow_bus = 720 articulated buses / hour (one lane, equivalent to 1 bus each 5 seconds)
Length_bus = 19.5 metres (18.5 metres  + 1 metre)

N_bus = 50/3600 * 200 / (1 – ( 200/720 )) = 3.8 buses

Because one cannot actually operate 3.8 buses, N_bus must be rounded to the nearest integer, so it is equal to 4.

Dist_station-intersection >= N_bus * Length_bus
Dist_station-intersection >= 4 * 19.5
Dist_station-intersection >= 78 metres

Thus, the minimum recommended distanced between the BRT station and the intersection would be 78 meters.

BRT systems currently in operation prove that  mixed traffic misbehaviour are a relevant source of operation disruptions throughout the public transport system. Traffic spillbacks are commonly seen in heavily congested intersections blocking perpendicular movements along the BRT corridor, so it may be proper to analyse the tolerance, space needed is proportional to red time. 



## Evaluating intersections

### Corridor audits


### Traffic sign impacts

### Closing intersections

Sometimes, intersections are too close together in order to optimise the station location relative to the intersection.  In such instances, an assessment has to be made in terms of how important the station location is for boarding and alighting passengers.  If it is an important location, the time savings benefits for pedestrians of locating a station close to this destination must be weighed against the likelihood time lost within the BRT system due to interference between the station and the intersection.   If there are no important destinations in that location, it is better not to locate a station there.  

Mixed traffic vehicles will most likely be able to pass through the two intersections using a synchronised signalisation system.  However, the same may not be true for BRT vehicles.  Instead, the BRT vehicle will pass through the green phase at the first intersection and then stop at the station for passenger boarding and alighting.  By the time the vehicle resumes movement towards the second intersection the signal phase may well have changed to red (Figure 9.48).  Thus, this configuration may lead to considerable delay for public transport passengers.

Figure 9.48 While mixed traffic vehicles may benefit from a synchronised green phase between two intersections, BRT passengers may encounter the red phase at the second intersection.

Even for normal mixed traffic, having two intersections too close together will sometimes lead to problems.  Vehicles queued at one intersection will back up to the point where vehicles are unable to clear the previous intersection during a green phase.   Equation 9.12 defines the calculation for the distance at which this type of conflict may occur.

Equation 9.12 Calculating the distance at which intersection conflicts occur

D12 < 3 * Max ( Tg1, Tg2 )

Where:

D12 = Distance between intersection 1 and intersection 2

Tg1 = Green signal time per phase cycle at intersection 1 

Tg2 = Green signal time per phase cycle at intersection 2

A mixed traffic lane can generally handle 1,800 vehicles per hour.  This quantity translates to two vehicles per second (3,600 seconds in an hour).  When vehicles are stopped at a stop light, the average amount of space they take up is 6 metres; this space includes the vehicle and some space between vehicles.  This average vehicle distance means that for each second of time, 3 metres of vehicle-equivalents can be moved through the intersection.  

Box 9.4 provides a sample calculation of the required spacing between two intersections.

## Grade Separation

“Look at all the buses now that want exact change, exact change. I figure if I give them exact change, they should take me exactly where I want to go.”
George C. Wallace

Grade-separation brings many benefits from the perspective of travel time savings by raising intersection capacity for both BRT vehicles and mixed traffic vehicles. But the infrastructure can be costly, depending on local circumstances.  In many instances, the time savings to BRT passengers and to private vehicles will fully justify the added infrastructure costs, but limited capital resources will typically constrain infrastructure expenditures.  

### Criteria for grade separation

In all of our BRT studies to date we have never really had to resort to a single flyover, meaning that there were always solutions to guarantee BRT operations that would reduce overall current travel times with the available space. In other words: without resorting to grade-separation, solutions are likely to be found where the advantages to public transport passengers are greater than prejudices to private vehicle users. Besides that, a corridor project usually have to deal with existing flyovers.

Nonetheless, when the capacity of a 4-phase intersection is reaching saturation (more than 600 vehicles/lane/hour), it is fairly typical for engineers to suggest the construction a flyover or an underpass that allows straight movement for one main road (2 of the 12 movements), while all other movements remain at the same level. Such general inclination often leads towards a political understanding that flyovers constructions along the BRT corridor are necessary. 

The introduction or existence of flyovers or underpasses in the corridor requires special treatments for BRT systems and they represent an opportunity to dramatically improve BRT vehicle operation.  Exclusive busway use of a flyover is a successful technique used in several existing BRT systems despite its potential major adverse visual impacts, which are highly undesirable from an aesthetics standpoint, in cities and urban areas.

Thus, the first option is to consider grade separation infrastructure to be dedicated to BRT usage.

While the discussion in this section is concentrated on flyovers as a means of grade separation, underpasses are frequently the preferred option from an aesthetics standpoint. Generally the cost of a busway on a flyover will be at least ten times the cost of a normal at-grade busway. The cost of a busway in an underpass will be similar to that of a flyover unless there are adverse subsurface conditions such as the presence of services (utilities), high water tables and hard rock conditions that may result in underpasses not being technically feasible or economically viable.


### Station location with grade separated solutions

If the grade-separated design solution maintains BRT lane through intersections, same concerns about queue blocking the stations apply for the traffic signal times on surface level. 

When BRT lane is grade separated, hindering the station is not a concern, but effective pedestrian access becomes a major issue.

In most instances, grade-separation will imply placing the stations away from the tunnel or overpass.  This siting restriction will add walking time for customers travelling between the station and the intersection, which crossing street is likely to abridge key destinations.  The Quito Central Norte line uses grade separation quite effectively with tunnels whisking BRT vehicles through congested intersection locations.  However, the tunnels also imply that at important destinations, such as the Plaza de las Américas (Plaza of the Americas), the closest station is a considerable distance away (Figure quito-under-roundabout-bad-station-location).  Thus, for the likely high number of customers from/to this busy area, the time savings from the grade-separation can be essentially lost due to the longer walk.

![quito-under-roundabout-bad-station-location](img/quito-under-roundabout-bad-station-location.jpg "In the case of Quito’s Central Norte line, the presence of an BRT underpass has meant that the closest station to a key destination, the Plaza of Américas commercial centre, is several hundred metres away.  Photo by Lloyd Wright.")

As an alternative to obtain intersection efficiency (with time savings that serve all passengers through the section) at the cost of convenient station location (that serves local-specific passengers), it is possible to place the station beneath or above the intersection. Many underground metro stations utilise station siting in this manner.  The Metro Center station of the Washington Metro exits directly into the basement floors of commercial shops.  In such cases, though, accessing ground-level shops and offices will require a grade transfer for customers, implying either stairs, escalators, and/or elevators.
Both the Brisbane and Ottawa BRT systems site stations at the tunnel level.  In Brisbane, the station is just before the tunnel and thus provides good customer access to local destinations (Figure Brisbane-station-before-tunnel).  In Ottawa, the station connects directly to a commercial shopping centre (Figure Ottawa-station-inside-tunnel).  Further, in the case of Ottawa, the tunnel station nicely protects customers from the harsh winter temperatures. Quito also has achieved great success with its Villa Flora station that goes beneath a heavily-trafficked roundabout on Maldonado Avenue (Figure quito-under-roundabout-good-station-location).

Effective pedestrian access as well as visually neutral solutions can be designed. For TransMilenio Phase II’s “Avenida Boyacá” station along the Avenida Suba Corridor, the adopted solution was to locate the station above Avenida Boyacá, level with the flyover. Pedestrians access the platform via an elevator from a small pedestrian plaza where fares are collected. This solution allowed for the strategic location of this station, which will make future transfer points on the projected Av. Boyacá closer from each other. Ultimately, the implementation of solutions of this sort will depend on budgetary constraints.

### Restricting turning movements together with grade-separation

A second possibility is when the flyover is built on the road perpendicular to the BRT corridor.  In this case, the flyover does not introduce any special difficulty and can help to alleviate  a BRT intersection and increase green phase time.

If a single flyover in the median is built for mixed traffic while BRT buses are forced to use surface streets, the buses in the median must cross the mixed traffic going over the flyover.  This problem is being confronted in Delhi.  This scenario creates either the need for a new signalised intersection prior to the flyover, or it requires a merge lane where the BRT buses and mixed traffic can cross, introducing possible delay and confusion for both the BRT system and the mixed traffic.  Figure 9.16 shows the conflict in a planned BRT system in Delhi where it must cross a mixed-traffic only flyover.  Clearly, in this scenario, it would be far better to dedicate the flyover (or at least the middle lanes of the flyover) to the BRT system.

Figure 9.16 Schematic of Delhi roadway in which BRT vehicles must cross mixed traffic that is attempting to access a flyover.

A third possibility is to construct two separate flyovers, one for each traffic direction, leaving a space between the flyover for the BRT system that allows BRT buses to continue along the surface. 

Figure New draw for 3rd possibility.

A fourth possibility is to allow the BRT vehicles to also pass over the flyover, either in a segregated lane, or if there is no space for a segregated lane, then in mixed traffic.  This last option sometimes results in stations being far from intersections, which may produce inconvenience for passengers seeking to reach destinations near the intersection.  Additionally, this configuration can be particularly problematic if there is a connecting BRT corridor running on the perpendicular street below the flyover or above the underpass.  

Option “H” shows the limited benefit of using a flyover or underpass if the BRT lanes remain at the surface level and four-phase signal timing is maintained (Figure 9.17).  In this scenario, the overall increase in intersection capacity is quite small with the capacity only rising from 600 pcu/lane/hour to 700 pcu/lane/hour.
If a single flyover in the median is built for mixed traffic while BRT buses are forced to use surface streets, the buses in the median must cross the mixed traffic going over the flyover.  This problem is being confronted in Delhi.  This scenario creates either the need for a new signalised intersection prior to the flyover, or it requires a merge lane where the BRT buses and mixed traffic can cross, introducing possible delay and confusion for both the BRT system and the mixed traffic.  Figure 9.16 shows the conflict in a planned BRT system in Delhi where it must cross a mixed-traffic only flyover.  Clearly, in this scenario, it would be far better to dedicate the flyover (or at least the middle lanes of the flyover) to the BRT system.

Option “H” is fairly common with conventional bus services in cities such as Bangkok (Figure 9.18).  Mixed traffic vehicles have access to the flyover and thus are given a substantial priority at the intersection.  By contrast, public transport vehicles servicing the intersection area are often mired in heavy congestion.  

Figure 9.17 Option “H”.

Figure 9.18 While mixed traffic vehicles can bypass a congested intersection in Bangkok, public transport vehicles are often consigned to serving stations near the intersection.  The result can be slow average speeds for public transport.  Photo by Lloyd Wright.

Option “I” is typical along a proposed BRT corridor in Guangzhou.  In this case, all straight movement is relocated to the flyover.  As a result, the number of signal phases for intersection on the surface is reduced to three (Figure 9.19). For this option, capacity increases marginally to 800 pcu/lane/hour.

Figure 9.19 In option “I”, the presence of a flyover handling all the straight vehicle movement in one direction (both mixed traffic vehicles and BRT vehicles), reduces the number of surface level phases to three.

Options “J” and “K” combine grade-separation infrastructure with limitations on turning movements.   Thus, options “J” and “K” essentially replicate many of the turning movements from option “D” but with the added benefit of grade separation in some directions.  In some cases, this combination may necessitate off-ramps from the flyover in order to facilitate certain turning movements (Figure 9.20).  The combination of these configurations dramatically increases the intersection’s potential capacity.  Option “J” is capable of delivering a capacity of 1,600 pcu/lane/hour while option “K” produces a capacity of 2000 pcu/lane/hour.


Figure 9.20 Combining grade separation with limitations on turning movements can produce intersection capacities as high as 2,000 pcu/lane/hour.

While both flyover and underpass options are presented here, underpasses are frequently a preferred option from a standpoint of aesthetics.  The proliferation of flyovers within a city environment can do much to scar an area’s visual image.  However, in cases where the road base is hard bedrock, underpass construction may be prohibitively expensive.  Likewise, if an area possesses a high water table, then an underpass may not be technically viable or desirable.  

This section has highlighted the idea that on any BRT corridor there are generally critical intersections where the addition of the new BRT system will create conditions nearing saturation.  If full four-phase signalisation is maintained in such conditions (options “A”, “B”, “H”, or “I”), then congestion is a likely result.  The best solutions tend to involve restrictions on turning movements plus, in some cases, grade separation.  Typically, turning restrictions and grade separation are far more effective in maximising intersection capacity than signal prioritisation or green-wave signal phasing.  

Any intersection, though, cannot be analysed in isolation.  Optimum results are usually obtained when vehicle movements are not only analysed at the particular intersection but also along the corridor and the entire extended area close to the intersection.

### BRT turning with grade separated solutions

Another alternative is to provide the dedicated turns through grade separated infrastructure. For heavy traffic corridors where free-flow turning is required to avoid breaking-down the system, the time savings certainly justify the costs.

Bogotá utilises grade separation both to provide dedicated turning infrastructure to BRT operations: overpasses and underpasses links corridors of 80th Street and Norte-Quito-Sur to an exclusive BRT roundabout (Figure NQS-80th-roundabout-photo and Figure NQS-80th-roundabout-topview) and a superlative BRT only third-floor roundabout completed in 2015 to guarantee that the interchange in Norte-Quito-Sur and Calle 6 has no delays (Figure construction-superlative-TransM-roundabout.jpg andfigure   

![NQS-80th-roundabout-photo.jpg](img/NQS-80th-TransM-roundabout-photo.jpg "An exclusive roundabout facilitate exclusive turning movements for BRT vehicles between two ways of NQS corridor and Calle 80 corridor. Photo courtesy of Eduardo Plata and Por el País que Queremos (PPQ).")

![superlative-TransM-roundabout.jpg](img/superlative-TransM-roundabout.jpg "TransMilenio operation superlative interchange was carefully planned from operational and aesthetical point of view. Image by courtesy of Instituto de Desarollo Urbano de Bogotá")


### BRT through roundabouts with grade separated solution

Construct a busway underpass that goes below the roundabout and avoids all conflicts with mixed traffic -- and thus promoting time savings for both BRT and mixed traffic -- is also a possibility, as the examples from Quito with good and bad station locations shows (Figure quito-under-roundabout-bad-station-location and Figure quito-under-roundabout-good-station).

![villa-flora-roundabout](img/villa-flora-quito-top.png "Quito's BRT avoids Vila Flora roundabout traffic with underpasses. Image from Google Earth")

A fly-over is also a possibility, but the design of an aesthetically acceptable solution is very challenging. With the exception of the superlative third floor roundabout above mixed-traffic roundabout of Bogotá mentioned in the previous section, there is no other project we have heard of.
