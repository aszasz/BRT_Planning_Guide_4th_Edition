Equip reader with tools to design and evaluate intersections

## Introduction

Intersection are places where roads cross each other, 
the use of the word in Traffic Engineering technical environment implies in "roads for vehicles" and "at the same level",
but very often the expressions "at-grade intersections" or "single grade intersections" are used to confirm the concept;
for fly-overs and underpasses the term used is "interchange" or still "separated-grade interchange".
When more than one mode is involved, the common traffic engineers wording is "crossing", 
and one of the road is assumed to be a "carriageway",
as in  "pedestrian crossing".

By this definition, intersection implies in conflicts for vehicles to use the same space,
and can refer to an unidirectional T-shaped or Y-shaped confluences;
the conflicts there gets clear when there is no space to accommodate the two incoming
flows on the exiting stream in a congested situation.

Conversely a channelled Y-shaped junction may not be an intersection.

A bi-directional T-shaped junction is clearly an intersection, as there are several conflicts to the use of the space.

Ideally a separated-grade traffic solution eliminates intersections, but in practice, due to space restrictions, intersections eventually remain.

## Basic Concepts

######PCU

A passenger-car unit, or pcu is a reference used to bring different vehicle types to a common denominator. The conversion factor from a certain type of vehicle to a passenger car unit depends of application intended after the conversion, being eventually calibrated for an specific use in an specific situation (for example if stress upon the pavement or congestion potential is considered, if such is in urban environment or in a highway, in a ramp or in plain terrain).

In any case, a motorcycle for example tends to have an equivalent of less than one vehicle, and a mini-bus is equivalent to more than one vehicle, the larger and heavier the vehicle, higher the equivalence is.

Traffic engineering borrow concepts from fluid mechanics and uses "flow" as a measure traffic intensity.
Flow can be expressed by the number of vehicles crossing a transversal section (like a stop line) during a certain time interval.
Flow is usually represented by letter q in equations, but we will avoid that here and use the full word instead.

It should be noted the use the word "volume" to express the same idea is generally accepted even it is conceptually wrong; volume should refer to total number of vehicles in the same way litres refers to volume and litres/second refers to flow in hydraulics. The term is specially common in the expression "volume/capacity ratio".

Capacity, by its turn is defined as the maximum flow a road can handle. As mentioned in Chapter 8, capacity and speed are related concepts and the maximum flow does not happens when speeds are maximum. Due a composition of the space a driver
