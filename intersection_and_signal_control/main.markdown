### Chapter overview

The objective of this chapter is to equip the reader with the best practice tools required to design the layout and operation of intersections along the proposed BRT corridors. Intersections are points where BRT vehicles can incur in significant delay and points where the BRT project has the most perceived impact on mixed traffic and walking.

An important strategy to improve the performance of intersections to better accommodate public transport and other vehicles is to restrict general-traffic turning movements at intersections. The BRT Standard awards up to 6 points for good handling of BRT movements through intersections, with the most points given to systems which prohibit all turns across the busway. 

Besides the above, this chapter also discusses the treatment of public transport vehicle turning movements, which are desirable, but equally harms intersections performance and the placement of stations relative to intersections along the corridor. Traffic-signal technology to provide public transport vehicles with priority and techniques to provide safety to pedestrians and cyclists are discussed too.

## Introduction

### About intersections

Intersection is the area where two or more roads encounter each other. 
The use of the word in Traffic Engineering technical environment implies in "roads for vehicles" and "at the same level",
but very often the expressions "at-grade intersections" or "single grade intersections" are used to confirm the concept;
for fly-overs and underpasses the term used is "interchange" or still "separated-grade interchange".
When more than one mode is involved, the common traffic engineers wording is "crossing", 
and one of the road is assumed to be a "carriageway", as in  "pedestrian crossing"; recently the term "multimodal intersection" has been applied.  

By this definition, intersection implies in conflicts for vehicles to use the same space,
and can refer to an unidirectional T-shaped or Y-shaped confluence area;
the conflicts there gets clear when there is no space to accommodate the two incoming
flows on the exiting stream in a congested situation.

![high volume in an Y-shaped intersection](img/crowded-Y-junction.png  "a Y junction that is an intersection")

Conversely a channelled Y-shaped junction may not be an intersection.

![channelled Y-shaped intersection](img/chanelled-Y-junction.png "a chanelled Y junction that is not an intersection" )

Considering the majority of cases of two or more roads meetings where there are many possible turning movements -- not all conflicting, intersections can be seen as several adjacent intersections as well. 

Once footpaths (or "roads for people") are more important to accessibility in populated areas, carriageways are usually constructed between footpaths. When two carriageways encounter, several walkways crossings are adjacent. So, a multimodal intersection encompasses a larger area where people conflict to use the same space. For clearance, let us remember that drivers and passengers are people.

The higher the number of conflicts in an intersection or in a crossing, higher is the time people will need to cross it safely.

If the frequency of vehicles arrivals at the intersection -- pedestrians and vehicles at a crossing -- is low, eventual passage negotiating is enough to maintain safety without compromising travel time.

If over the years the vehicle frequencies along the day rise to the point where queues happen often and last long or the time required to pedestrians to cross safely becomes too long is the moment to intervene.

An interference is justified by the comparing the present value of costs for its implementation, maintenance and operation against the value of its benefits, of which the most easier to establish are the time savings assuming a safe operation and does directly related to it (as fuel consumption and pollution).

Interventions start with zebras and yielding signs. Channelling the vehicles and creating refuge islands is a manner to clearly divide an intersection in the several smaller intersection components, improving traffic safety and reducing the overall delay; roundabouts or mini-roundabouts are ways to channel vehicles as well. Above a certain point, traffic lights are required, that may grow really complex in order to accommodate all conflicts; then traffic diversion and restricting direct movements come at play... until the grade separation becomes necessary.

Ideally a separated-grade traffic solution eliminates intersections, but in practice, due to space restrictions, intersections eventually remain.

![separated-grade solutions with remaining intersections ](img/sep-grade-solution.png "Separated-grade solutions may not eliminate intersections")

BRT systems are generally built on corridors where mixed traffic congestion is already a problem, or where congestion is likely to occur in the near future, otherwise there would be no benefit of building a segregated busway.  The worse the congestion appears, the greater the benefit of the exclusive busway (Figure congested-intersection.jpg) If a BRT system makes public transport services better but mixed traffic worse, it will be less politically successful than if it makes public transport better and also improves mixed traffic flow.  BRT system planners therefore generally try to minimise adverse impacts on mixed traffic.

### Approach to intersection design

Even intersections alone are usually less critical than stations,   they represent a critical point along any BRT corridor (Figure 24.1). A poorly designed intersection or a poorly timed signal phase can substantially reduce system capacity and speed, specially by hindering stations. Finding solutions to optimizing intersection performance can do much to improve system efficiency. Generally, the three main objectives of intersection design along a BRT corridor are to:

1. Minimize delay for BRT vehicles;
2. Provide safe and convenient crossings for pedestrians;
3. Minimize delay for mixed traffic.

Once BRT vehicles may ride in mixed traffic and accessibility is paramount to BRT projects

![pedestrians-crossing-corridor](img/pedestrians-crossing-corridor.jpg "Intersection design affects the BRT system’s efficiency, pedestrian safety and access, and flows of mixed traffic vehicles. Photo by Lloyd Wright.")

It is generally not advisable to use a standard intersection configuration throughout a BRT corridor. Rather, it is best to design the intersection for the specific conditions at the given location. The impact of a planned BRT system on overall intersection performance is often a significant consideration when deciding on a service plan for the BRT system, the location of the stations, and the design of the stations.

BRT system planners have tended to approach intersections in the following manner: 

- Simplify the BRT system’s routing structure and rationalize major and minor intersections along the routes chosen;
- Identify existing bottlenecks and resolve using standard engineering practice;
- Restrict as many mixed-traffic turning movements on the BRT corridors as possible;
- Optimize the location of the station relative to adjacent intersections;
- Optimize the signal phasing; 
- In low-frequency BRT corridors, consider signal priority for public transport vehicles.

Every decision and solution proposed during the intersection design process should be technically supported by the elaboration of a comprehensive traffic study, where classified and directional flow counts are carried out at every active intersection (signalized or not) along the corridor being designed. This is necessary to diagnose the current performance of each intersection and forecast a future scenario incorporating the operational changes a BRT corridor might bring. 

## Basic Concepts


We present here only the concepts needed to understanding the equations that are included in this chapter, the reader may further investigate the concepts of traffic density and traffic headway, and how they relate with traffic average speed and traffic flow.

Before that, we emphasize that when applying formulas, attention should be given to units and units conversions, as the appropriate dimension to perceive phase times in traffic lights or the time to walk or ride a few blocks is seconds while we better perceive speeds in kilometres or miles per hour. It is useful to remember that 1 hour is the same as 3600 seconds and one mile is approximately 1.6 kilometres and 1 kilometre is approximately 0.6 miles.

### i-turn and o-turn

For this chapter we excluded the expressions right-turn and left-turn as they have different meanings in different hand-way systems. We choose to adopt the i-turn and o-turn. We chosen this cryptic words instead of more explanatory expressions like "against-opposite-flow-exit-turn" so it can be short in the text; and we choose it against shorter and less explanatory expressions as "inside-turn" or "central-turn" to force the reader look for this concepts here, instead of assuming a less clear meaning or be left in doubt.


*i-turn*: a vehicle movement to exit the current traffic stream direction that requires crossing the flow in the opposite way. If a busway or a bike lane is present near the medium, there is also conflict the BRT vehicles or bicycles going straight in the same way as in opposite way.

*o-turn*: a vehicle movement to exit the current traffic stream direction that normally does not cross any vehicle flow. This movement conflicts with people on the side walk in both ways and if the road abridges curb-side busway or a curbside bike-lane, there is conflict with that traffic as well.

*u-turn* (this is the usual concept, included here only for completeness, as this is not always obvious for non-native speakers): a vehicle movement to join  the traffic stream in the opposite way of the direction it is current flow. Depending on the width of the medium this movement can be less conflicting than the i-turn or more conflicting as the speed has to be lower. This movement is sometimes moved away from the intersection where other movements are allowed, creating another intersection exclusively for it. Due to road geometry restriction or other considerations, this movement eventually is channelized to start from a waiting area from the curb-side of the road, in which case it will conflict with both flows in the same way a i turn from a perpendicular street would (figure u-turn-only-intersection).

### Speed

For application with the concepts outlined in this chapter, speed, to which we use the letter V from the synonymous velocity, is the average traffic speed of all vehicles in a segment. It would be measured by the mean time all vehicles crossing the segment divided by the segment extension. Under our modelling intents (that is capacity evaluation) it can be imagined that all vehicles are moving in that speed.

Still matching the broader concept of speed -- the ratio of motion expressed in distance per unit of time -- it is useful to remember that given a segment length (D_segment, for distance), knowing the speed (V_segment) is equivalent of knowing the travel time (Time_segment) through the segment and vice-versa, as the equivalent equations show:

V_segment = D_segment / Time_segment  <-->  Time_segment = D_segment / V_segment

### pcu

A passenger-car unit, or pcu is a reference used to bring different vehicle types to a common denominator. The conversion factor from a certain type of vehicle to a passenger car unit depends of application intended after the conversion, being eventually calibrated for an specific use in an specific situation (for example if stress upon the pavement or congestion potential is considered, if such is in urban environment or in a highway, in a ramp or in plain terrain).

In any case, a motorcycle for example tends to have an equivalent of less than one vehicle, and a mini-bus is equivalent to more than one vehicle, the larger and heavier the vehicle, higher the equivalence is.

### Flow 

Traffic engineering borrow concepts from fluid mechanics and uses "flow rate" as a measure traffic intensity.
From that definition, the word "rate" is commonly dropped and "flow" alone becomes treated as physical quantity expressed by the number of vehicles crossing a transversal section (or cross-section, like a stop line) during a certain time interval. Flow is usually represented by letter q in equations, but we will avoid that here and use the full word instead.

It should be noted the use the word "volume" to express the same idea is accepted even it is conceptually even more far from the original definition (fluid mechanics original comparative term would be "volume flow rate" even "mass flow rate" is more appropriated reference as the same number of vehicles can be compressed); volume should refer to total number of vehicles in the same way litres refers to volume and litres/second refers to flow in hydraulics. The term is specially common in the expression "volume/capacity ratio", which makes particular sense.

### Capacity and Saturation 

The capacity (flow rate) of a segment is given by the lower capacity of a section within it, the term "bottleneck" for the lower-capacity-section express this concept quite clearly.

The capacity of a section by its turn is defined as the maximum flow a section can handle under prevailing use. It is subject to the number of lanes, width of lanes, ramp inclination, the use of surrounding areas --  as parking and stopping regulations, presence of intersection or traffic light ahead, bus stops existence and frequencies and  cultural driving behaviours.

Capacity can be easily and objectively measured, but some of the influential factors cannot. Many models have been developed to improve forecast of road capacity based on the knowledge of design and use of surrounds and even the more detailed simulators needs careful calibration to correctly represent driver behaviours changes, that tend to be unique to each place.

The simpler models commonly don't fit exactly to theories either and are usually adjusted by experimental evidence. These resort to the concept of *basic saturation*.

Basic saturation (flow rate) is the capacity for a section of a given standard ideal carriageway, divided by number of lanes of that given standard carriage way.

Capacity and speed are inter-dependent and the maximum flow does not happens when speeds are maximum. This happens due to the fact that the distance a driver maintains from the vehicle in front of it raises more than proportionally than the speed increase. The speed maximum capacity occurs in a section of unconstrained road is between 60 and 80 kph (km/hour).

Capacity models then define a way to forecast a *saturation flow* multiplying the basic saturation flow by adjustment factors to account for various non-ideal geometric, traffic, and environmental conditions of a given section, such as number of lanes, lane width, heavy vehicles, grade, parking facilities, bus blockage, area type, turning traffic along the segment, radius of turnings, pedestrian crossing traffic, but not considering traffic lights.

Saturation (flow rate), therefore, is the capacity of a section that is not under the influence of traffic light; for section that approach the traffic light, saturation is the capacity assuming a constant green, which would equal to the flow observed during the queueing discharge. For this reason saturation maybe called discharge (flow rate).

A practical rule, even distorting a bit the concept of ideal conditions is that: for urban environments, the basic saturation of a lane is 1800 pcu/hour. For the purpose of capacity measuring an 18-metres-articulated bus is equivalent to 2.5 car-passengers-unit. So in a busway, the basic saturation per lane is 720 articulated-bus/hour.

### Continuity

Although no direct formula application about continuity is used in this chapter, one basic equation of an intersection is that all the flow into the intersection has to exit the intersection.

### Traffic signal and traffic signal times

Traffic lights are a very common intersection management tool in business district areas where the BRT corridor design is likely to face the more challenging problems. Traffic lights controllers can be coordinated and actuated (use detection) by more or less complex technology and algorithms, a lot of research and development have been made in the last 30 years, but its use is relatively limited. The concepts presented in this chapter are useful to understand BRT design requirements to program traffic lights, be it on simpler controllers or as policy delimiters to more complex systems.

Traffic lights eliminate some of the negotiations between vehicles on arrival, by determining which movements may proceed at a given moment. Traffic lights may allow conflicting movements, usually not all of them intense; pedestrian crossing the transversal street is commonly one of them. By reducing negotiations, traffic light prevents that all vehicles approaching the intersection reduce their speeds, and the time each vehicle spends on the intersection itself and increasing the throughput and safety.


###### Phase

One set of movements that are allowed to occur at the same time is called a signal phase. It should be noted that some movements are allowed during several phases;in many countries, allowing o-turns at all times is the standard. Some writers, ourselves eventually included, may use expressions like "allowing a particular turn in the beginning of  phase two" when technically it should be "adding a short phase before phase 2 where particular turn will be allowed". 

###### Effective green time (T_green)

The phase duration (or length) refers to its "effective green" time, which is the time vehicles doing the movement considered are effectively moving, which may start a little after the green light is given and end in the middle of yellow lights (where such is used), or in the first moments of red (clearance interval). For this chapter, where queueing and intersection capacity is evaluated, green time means "effective green" time.

###### Cycle time (T_cycle)

Excluding situations where special phases are activated by detectors, the traffic signals on an intersection repeats the order of the phases successively in cycles. The cycle time can be measured as the time between the green light is given to a movement till the next time it is given to that movement again (after it has changed to red once). In this chapter, "cycle time" alone refers to a traffic light cycle time (route cycle times are not discussed).

###### Red time (T_red)

For the interest of intersection capacity and queueing evaluation, red time means cycle time minus (effective) green time

###### Traffic light plans

In the same way as intersections in general, the higher the number of turning movements in a intersection with traffic lights, higher is the difficult to serve them all. Some movements can happen simultaneously, some cannot.

The optimal phase times in a signalized intersection is such that the cycle time is as brief as possible without forming queues. The problem to be dealt with is that every phase change there is a considerable lost time between the end of the effective green of a phase and the start of the next that depends both of the signal programming, enforcement policy, and driver behaviour. Longer the lost times results in safer the intersections.

But because travel demand patterns change along the day, the signal timing plans should too. 





![traffic-lights-diagram](img/traffic-light-stages.png "flow and queue formation during traffic light phases")

Traffic signals programming shall change along the day

### Delay

Delay is the additional travel time, if not explicit, the base reference is the travel time without any conflicts, in an ideal situation where the passenger, pedestrian or driver is the only user of the road (no other drivers, pedestrians users or traffic lights).

### Intersection capacity

In the right perspective for this chapter analysis, intersection capacity refers to the entrance section (the stop line) of a road segment under study.

Considering the definition of intersection as the area where vehicles come into conflict, the capacity of the intersection should be measured as the total number of (equivalent) vehicles that crossed it not caring for the movements. But in this chapter the analysis refers to the section 


Similarly to most of other design decisions that affect infrastructure needs, intersection design, should be made considering the peak conditions, but unlikely station infrastructure and intersection design, traffic time timing that minimizes travel time in on 

and to represent the peak we both use and measure the busiest hour of the day (as a reminder: we survey data with smaller intervals than on hour, so a given measure of busiest hour might have happened from 7:15 AM to 8:15 AM for example).
